#* On the Multiple Implementation of Abstract Data Types Within a Computation
#@ J. R White
#t 1983
#c IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering
#! A fundamental step in the software design process is the selection of a refinement (implementation) for a data abstraction. This step traditionally involves investigating the expected performance of a system under different refinements of an abstraction and then selecting a single alternative which minimizes some performance cost metric. In this paper we reformulate this design step to allow different refinements of the same data abstraction within a computation. This reformulation reflects the fact that the implementation appropriate for a data abstraction is dependent on the behavior exhibited by the objects of the abstraction. Since this behavior can vary among the objects of a computation, a single refinement is often inappropriate. Accordingly, three frameworks are presented for understanding and representing variations in the behavior of objects and, thus, the potential for multiple implementations. The three frameworks are based upon: 1) a static partitioning of objects into disjoint implementation classes; 2) static partitioning of classes into implementation regions; and 3) dynamic partitioning of classes into implementation regions. These frameworks and analytic tools useful in investigating expected performance under multiple implementations are described in detail.

#! From the Preface (See Front Matter for full Preface) Advances in the design and production of computer hardware have brought many more people into direct contact with computers. Similar advances in the design and production of computer software are required in order that this increased contact be as rewarding as possible. The Smalltalk-80 system is a result of a decade of research into creating computer software that is appropriate for producing highly functional and interactive contact with personal computer systems. This book is the first detailed account of the Smalltalk-80 system. It is divided into four major parts: Part One -- an overview of the concepts and syntax of the programming language. Part Two -- an annotated and illustrated specification of the system's functionality. Part Three -- an example of the design and implementation of a moderate-size application. Part Four -- a specification of the Smalltalk-80 virtual machine.

#! The trie data structure has many properties which make it especially attractive for representing large files of data. These properties include fast retrieval time, quick unsuccessful search determination, and finding the longest match to a given identifier. The main drawback is the space requirement. In this paper the concept of trie compaction is formalized. An exact algorithm for optimal trie compaction and three algorithms for approximate trie compaction are given, and an analysis of the three algorithms is done. The analysis indicate that for actual tries, reductions of around 70 percent in the space required by the uncompacted trie can be expected. The quality of the compaction is shown to be insensitive to the number of nodes, while a more relevant parameter is the alphabet size of the key.

#! This work investigates one aspect of the performance of CODASYL database systems: the data reference behavior. We introduce a model of database traversals at three levels: the logical, internal, and physical levels. The mapping between the logical and internal levels is defined by the internal schema, whereas the mapping between the internal and the physical levels depends on cluster properties of the database. Our model explains the physical reference behavior for a given sequence of DML statements at the logical level.Software has been implemented to monitor references in two selected CODASYL DBMS applications. In a series of experiments the physical reference behavior was observed for varying internal schemas and cluster properties of the database. The measurements were limited to retrieval transactions, so that a variety of queries could be analyzed for the same well-known state of the database. Also, all databases were relatively small in order to allow fast reloading with varying internal schema parameters. In all cases, the database transactions showed less locality of reference than do programs under virtual memory operating systems; some databases showed no locality at all. No evidence of physical sequentiality was found. This suggests that standard page replacement strategies are not optimal for CODASYL database buffer management; instead, replacement decisions in a database buffer should be based on specific knowledge available from higher system layers.

#! This paper presents the design of a relational query processor. The query processor consists of only four processing PIPEs and a number of random-access memory modules. Each PIPE processes tuples of relations in a bit-serial, tuple-parallel manner for each of the primitive database operations which comprise a complex relational query. The design of the query processor meets three major objectives: the query processor must be manufacturable using existing and near-term LSI (VLSI) technology; it must support in a uniform manner both the numeric and nonnumeric processing requirements a high-level user interface like SQL presents; and it must support the query-processing strategy derived in the query optimizer to satisfy certain system-wide performance optimality criteria.

#! The problem of statistical database confidentiality in releasing microdata is addressed through the use of approximate data-swapping. Here, a portion of the microdata is replaced with a database that has been selected with approximately the same statistics. The result guarantees the confidentiality of the original data, while providing microdata with accurate statistics. Methods for achieving such transformations are considered and analyzed through simulation.

#! Several researchers (Beeri, Bernstein, Chiu, Fagin, Goodman, Maier, Mendelzon, Ullman, and Yannakakis) have introduced a special class of database schemes, called acyclic or tree schemes. Beeri et al. have shown that an acyclic join dependency, naturally defined by an acyclic database scheme, has several desirable properties, and that an acyclic join dependency is equivalent to a conflict-free set of multivalued dependencies. However, since their results are confined to multivalued and join dependencies, it is not clear whether we can handle functional dependencies independently of other dependencies.In the present paper we define an extension of a conflict-free set, called an extended conflict-free set, including multivalued dependencies and functional dependencies, and show the following two properties of an extended conflict-free set:There are three equivalent definitions of an extended conflict-free set. One of them is defined as a set including an acyclic joint dependency and a set of functional dependencies such that the left and right sides of each functional dependency are included in one of the attribute sets that construct the acyclic join dependency.For a relation scheme with an extended conflict-free set, there is a decomposition into third normal form with a lossless join and preservation of dependencies.

#c IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering
#! A very simple and efficient technique for the introduction of separate compilation facilities into compilers for block-structured languages is presented. Using this technique, programs may be compiled in parts while the compile-time checking advantages of compilation as a whole are retained. These features are simple for a programmer to understand and are easy to implement. Experience has shown this separate compilation mechanism to be a useful tool in the development of large programs in block-structured languages.

#* Implementing language support in high-level languages
#@ Martin S. McKendry;Roy H. Campbell
#t 1984
#c IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering
#! One of the requirements for building an operating system in a high-level operating system language, such as Ada, Concurrent Pascal, or Modula, is the construction of a language support system, or kernel. This paper presents a model that generalizes the concept of a kernel, and defines a kernel and the processes it supports to be at different levels of abstraction. A high-level language mechanism, the Execute statement, is then proposed as the basis of the interface between a kernel and the processes it supports. Software capabilities control access between levels and the Execute statement controls processor context switching between levels. The mechanisms rely on data typing for reliability and protection. They encourage systems that are well protected and exhibit an explicit hierarchical structure. Software capabilities and the Execute statement are illustrated with a pilot implementation on the Prime 650. An experimental operating system that encompasses their use is discussed. Extensions are presented which manage interrupts, timeslicing and preemption, and hardware protection mechanisms.

#* Multiaccess in a nonqueueing mailbox environment
#@ Michael J. Ferguson
#t 1984
#c IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering
#! A new and flexible solution to the problem of multiple users accessing a single resource, such as communication bandwidth or composite object in memory, is derived. The means of communication consists of sending and receiving messages in known locations (or equivalently, mailboxes without queueing). Any particular user is able to deposit, and hence destroy, previous messages in a mailbox. It is assumed that exclusive access to a mailbox is supplied by an underlying system. The major results of this paper are: 1) a simple tree-based algorithm that guarantees 驴 no user or group of users can conspire to prevent access by some other user to the resource; 驴 only one user accesses the resource at a time; 驴 if there are N users, an individual user is guaranteed access, when requested, to the resource in no more than N-1 turns; Knuth's solution [6] can delay a user up to 2** (N-1)-1 turns; 2) an extension of Dekker's algorithm (2 users) [2] that allows the relative rates of reservations for access to the resource to be proportional to a set of N integers. When a reservation is not being used by its ``owner,'' it will be assigned to another contending request. The assignment is optimal for periodic requests.

#! The control of concurrent access to shared resources is an important feature of both centralized and distributed operating systems. In conventional systems, exclusive access is the rule while concurrent access is the exception. Dataflow computer systems, along with an applicative style of programming, provide an execution environment in which this philosophy is reversed. In these latter systems, it is necessary to reexamine the manner in which synchronization of access to shared resources is specified and implemented. A basic design for a dataflow resource manager is reviewed, illustrating the clear separation between access mechanism and scheduling policy. The semantics of the access mechanism is based solely on the principle of data dependency. Specifications are presented for a general scheduler to further constrain or order accesses to the resource. Using ``open path expressions'' as a very high-level specification language for synchronization, it is shown how to automatically synthesize a scheduler as a distributed network of communicating modules.

#* Resilient distributed computing
#@ Liba Svobodova
#t 1984
#c IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering
#! A control abstraction called atomic action is a powerful general mechanism for ensuring consistent behavior of a system in spite of failures of individual computations running in the system, and in spite of system crashes. However, because of the ``all-or-nothing'' property of atomic actions, an important amount of work might be abandoned needlessly when an internal error is encountered. This paper discusses how implementation of resilient distributed systems can be supported using a combination of nested atomic actions and stable checkpoints. Nested atomic actions form a tree structure. When an internal atomic action terminates, its results are not made permanent until the outermost atomic action commits, but they survive local node failures. Each subtree of atomic actions is recoverable individually. A checkpoint is established in stable storage as part of a remote request so that results of such a request can be reclaimed if the requesting node fails in the meantime, The paper shows how remote procedure call primitives with ``at-most-once'' semantics and recovery blocks can be built with these mechanisms.

#* Intervention schedules for real-time programming
#@ Curtis Abbott
#t 1984
#c IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering
#! A way of programming real-time systems is described which inverts the usual image of parallel processes: instead of processes which are ordinarily running and which wait occasionally in order to synchronize with other cooperating processes, ``intervention schedules'' are ordinarily waiting and run nonpreemptibly, triggered by events, which may be external (modeling hardware interrupts) or generated by other intervention schedules. In order for nonpreemptive scheduling to make sense, the maximum period of time for which any event in an intervention schedule runs must be carefully controlled. This and other aspects of the model are considered, and it is compared with more traditional models of parallel processes, and with message passing models. Programming language features to support this programmming model are discussed. Strengths and limitations of the model are discussed.

#* A heuristic for deriving loop functions
#@ Douglas D. Dunlop;Victor R. Basili
#t 1984
#c IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering
#! The problem of analyzing an initialized loop and verifying that the program computes some particular function of its inputs is addressed. A heuristic technique for solving these problems is proposed that appears to work well in many commonly occurring cases. The use of the technique is illustrated with a number of applications. An attribute of initialized loops is identified that corresponds to the ``effort'' required to apply this method in a deterministic (i.e., guaranteed to succeed) manner. It is explained that in any case, the success of the proposed heuristic relies on the loop exhibiting a ``reasonable'' form of behavior.

#* Safe data type specifications
#@ N C.K Phillips
#t 1984
#c IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering
#! This paper discusses the current style of algebraic data type specifications. Some simple examples illustrate that whether or not two objects of the type being specified are equal can be implementation dependent, even for very simple objects of the type. To remedy this, it is proposed that specifications should be safe, where safety is a stronger requirement than Guttag's sufficient completeness. The paper also discusses when an operator should be part of a specification and when it should be introduced by extension, and concludes with safe specifications of some common data types.

#* Prototyping versus specifying: a multiproject experiment
#@ Barry W. Boehm;Terence E. Gray;Thomas Seewaldt
#t 1984
#c IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering
#! In this experiment, seven software teams developed versions of the same small-size (2000-4000 source instruction) application software product. Four teams used the Specifying approach. Three teams used the Prototyping approach. The main results of the experiment were the following. 1) Prototyping yielded products with roughly equivalent performance, but with about 40 percent less code and 45 percent less effort. 2) The prototyped products rated somewhat lower on functionality and robustness, but higher on ease of use and ease of learning. 3) Specifying produced more coherent designs and software that was easier to integrate. The paper presents the experimental data supporting these and a number of additional conclusions.

#* A relational representation of an abstract type system
#@ Daniel L. Weller;Bryant W. York
#t 1984
#c IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering
#! Programming languages have traditionally had more data types than database systems. The flexibility of abstract types could make a database system more useful in supporting application development. Abstract types allow users to think about and manipulate data in terms and structures that they are familiar with. This paper proposes that databases have a type system interface and describes a representation of a type system in terms of relations. The type system model supports a variety of programming language constructs, such as user-defined parameterized data types and user-defined generic operations. The efficiency of the type system is compared to the access time of the database system.

#* A unifying approach to the design of a secure database operating system
#@ David L. Spooner;Ehud Gudes
#t 1984
#c IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering
#! Database management systems (DBMS's) today are usually built as subsystems on top of an operating system (OS). This design approach can lead to problems of unreliability and inefficient performance as well as forcing a duplication of functions between the DBMS and OS. A new design approach is proposed which eliminates much of this duplication by integrating the duplicated functions into independent subsystems used by both the DBMS and OS. Specifically, an I/O and file support subsystem and a security subsystem are defined. Both subsystems make use of a logical information model which models the stored information in secondary storage. The new database operating system organization and the logical information model are presented in detail. Design of the security subsystem is based on the access control model, and is extended with Boolean predicates to produce an access control model capable of enforcing content-dependent security policies. The access matrix is implemented using a combination of access lists and capabilities. Authorization models and multiple user processes are discussed in relation to the new system organization. The outline of a formal specification and proof of correctness of the security subsystem is also discussed.

#! A simple and general definition of denial-of-service in operating systems is presented. It is argued that no current protection mechanism nor model resolves this problem in any demonstrable way. The notion of interuser dependency is introduced and identified as the common cause for all problem instances. Decomposition of operating systems into hierarchies of services is assumed for the discovery of denial-of-service instances.

Thisintuitive presentation is underpinned by a formal syntax,semantics, and derivation system for the method. Completeness andsoundness theorems establish the correctness of the derivationsystem with respect to the semantics, the coextensiveness of thesyntactic definitions of consistency and totalness with theirsemantic counterparts, and the correctness of the proof methodspresented.

#! The information-based study of the optimal solution of largelinear systems is initiated by studying the case of Krylovinformation. Among the algorithms that use Krylov information areminimal residual, conjugate gradient, Chebyshev, and successiveapproximation algorithms. A "sharp" lower bound on the number ofmatrix-vector multiplications required to compute anå-approximation is obtained for any orthogonally invariantclass of matrices. Examples of such classes include many ofpractical interest such as symmetric matrices, symmetric positivedefinite matrices, and matrices with bounded condition number. Itis shown that the minimal residual algorithm is within at most onematrix-vector multiplication of the lower bound. A similar resultis obtained for the generalized minimal residual algorithm. Thelower bound is computed for certain classes of orthogonallyinvariant matrices. How the lack of certam properties (symmetry,positive definiteness) increases the lower bound is shown. Aconjecture and a number of open problems are stated.

#! During the past ten years, the field of multiple-accesscommunication has developed into a major area of both practical andtheoretical interest within the field of computer communications.The multiple-access problem arises from the necessity of sharing asingle communication channel among a community of distributedusers. The distributed algorithm used by the stations to share thechannel is known as the multiple-access protocol. In this paper weexamine the multiple-access problem and various approaches to itsresolution.In this survey we first define the multiple-access problem andthen present the underlying issues and difficulties in achievingmultiple-access communication. A taxonomy for multiple-accessprotocols is then developed in order to characterize commonapproaches and to provide a framework within which these protocolscan be compared and contrasted. Different proposed protocols arethen described and discussed, and aspects of their performance areexamined. The use of multiple-access protocols for "real- time" or"time-constrained" communication applications, such as voicetransmission, is examined next. Issues in time-constrainedcommunication are identified, and recent work in the design oftime-constrained multiple-access protocols is surveyed.

#! The rapidly evolving field of local network technology hasproduced a steady stream of local network products in recent years.The IEEE 802 standards that are now taking shape, because of theircomplexity, do little to narrow the range of alternative technicalapproaches and at the same time encourage more vendors into thefield. The purpose of this paper is to present a systematic,organized overview of the alternative architectures for and designapproaches to local networks.The key elements that determine the cost and performance of alocal network are its topology, transmission medium, and mediumaccess control protocol. Transmission media include twisted pair,baseband and broadband coaxial cable, and optical fiber. Topologiesinclude bus, tree, and ring. Medium access control protocolsinclude CSMA/CD, token bus, token ring, register insertion, andslotted ring. Each of these areas is examined in detail,comparisons are drawn between competing technologies, and thecurrent status of standards is reported.

#! Several new methods are presented for selecting n records at random without replacement from a file containing N records. Each algorithm selects the records for the sample in a sequential manner—in the same order the records appear in the file. The algorithms are online in that the records for the sample are selected iteratively with no preprocessing. The algorithms require a constant amount of space and are short and easy to implement. The main result of this paper is the design and analysis of Algorithm D, which does the sampling in O(n) time, on the average; roughly n uniform random variates are generated, and approximately n exponentiation operations (of the form ab, for real numbers a and b) are performed during the sampling. This solves an open problem in the literature. CPU timings on a large mainframe computer indicate that Algorithm D is significantly faster than the sampling algorithms in use today.

The system is intended to test the use of the universal view, in which the entire database is seen as one relation. This paper describes the theory behind System/U, in particular the theory of maximal objects and the connection between a set of attributes. We also describe the implementation of the DDL (Data Description Language) and the DML (Data Manipulation Language), and discuss in detail how the DDL finds maximal objects and how the DML determines the connection between the attributes that appear in a query.

#! The query inference problem is to translate a sentence of a query language into an unambiguous representation of a query. A query is represented as an expression over a set of query trees. A metric is introduced for measuring the complexity of a query and also a proposal that a sentence be translated into the least complex query which “satisfies” the sentence. This method of query inference can be used to resolve ambiguous sentences and leads to easier formulation of sentences.

#! A modification of linear hashing is proposed for which the conventional use of overflow records is avoided. Furthermore, an implementation of linear hashing is presented for which the amount of physical storage claimed is only fractionally more than the minimum required. This implementation uses a fixed amount of in-core space. Simulation results are given which indicate that even for storage utilizations approaching 95 percent, the average successful search cost for this method is close to one disk access.

#! In recent years the information processing requirements of business organizations have expanded tremendously. With this expansion, the design of databases to efficiently manage and protect business information has become critical. We analyze the impacts of record segmentation (the assignment of data items to segments defining subfiles), an efficiency-oriented design technique, and of backup and recovery strategies, a data protection technique, on the overall process of database design. A combined record segmentation/backup and recovery procedure is presented and an application of the procedure is discussed. Results in which problem characteristics are varied along three dimensions: update frequencies, available types of access paths, and the predominant type of data retrieval that must be supported by the database, are presented.

#! Using the nested loops method, this paper addresses the problem of minimizing the number of page fetches necessary to evaluate a given query to a relational database. We first propose a data structure whereby the number of page fetches required for query evaluation is substantially reduced and then derive a formula for the expected number of page fetches. An optimal solution to our problem is the nesting order of relations in the evaluation program, which minimizes the number of page fetches. Since the minimization of the formula is NP-hard, as shown in the Appendix, we propose a heuristic algorithm which produces a good suboptimal solution in polynomial time. For the special case where the input query is a “tree query,” we present an efficient algorithm for finding an optimal nesting order.

#! A protocol for transaction processing during partition failures is presented which guarantees mutual consistency between copies of data-items after repair is completed. The protocol is “optimistic” in that transactions are processed without restrictions during failure; conflicts are then detected at repair time using a precedence graph, and are resolved by backing out transactions according to some backout strategy. The resulting database state then corresponds to a serial execution of some subset of transactions run during the failure. Results from simulation and probabilistic modeling show that the optimistic protocol is a reasonable alternative in many cases. Conditions under which the protocol performs well are noted, and suggestions are made as to how performance can be improved. In particular, a backout strategy is presented which takes into account individual transaction costs and attempts to minimize total backout cost. Although the problem of choosing transactions to minimize total backout cost is, in general, NP-complete, the backout strategy is efficient and produces very good results.

#* The ADA/ED system: a large-scale experiment in software prototyping using SETL
#@ Philippe Kruchten;Edmond Schonberg
#t 1984
#c Technology and Science of Informatics
#! In my view, the most interesting aspect of thisexperiment with prototypes is its implications for software engineering:everyone talks about prototypes today, but is anyone really producingany? Or, amongst those who do produce prototypes, how many can resistthe temptation, once the prototype is complete, to treat it as thefinished product? The experiences described here present a clear cutcase: it would have been impossible to write the compiler immediately inits final form—the cost of perpetual modifications, in response torevisions to ADA, of a compiler written in a `traditional' languagewould have been intolerably high—designing a prototype seems tohave been the only way out.Finally, once a decision in favor of prototypes has been taken,either as a way of giving concrete expression to a set of specificationsor a way of `protecting' a particular design, a choice of language inwhich to write the prototype has to be made. The advantages of SETL areclearly demonstrated in this article, with particular stress laid on thefacilities it provides for using several semantic levels, and thereforerefining a prototype in successive stages until the final productemerges, or a program very close to the final product. Translation intoa language providing for a higher performance level, or at any rate intoa more common language, C in this case, is then a simple task. My guessis that a lot of TSI readers are going to want more information on SETLto enable them to use it in similar circumstances in the future.To sum up, this article is particularly interesting for threereasons: it provides a closer understanding of ADA, demonstrates thevalue of prototypes in software design, and makes a plea in favor ofSETL which does indeed appear wholly satisfactory as a language in whichto write such prototypes.—From the Commentary by E. Girard—Commentary recommended by E. A. Feustel, Sherborn, MA

#! Performance in database systems is strongly influenced by buffer management and transaction recovery methods. This paper presents the principles of the database cache, which replaces the traditional buffer. In comparison to buffer management, cache management is more carefully coordinated with transaction management, and integrates transaction recovery. High throughput ofsmall- and medium-sized transactions is achieved by fast commit processing and low database traffic. Very fast handling of transaction failures and short restart time after system failure are guaranteed in such an environment. Very long retrieval and update transactions are also supported.

#! Various logging and recovery techniques for centralized transaction-oriented database systems under performance aspects are described and discussed. The classification of functional principles that has been developed in a companion paper is used as a terminological basis. In the main sections, a set of analytic models is introduced and evaluated in order to compare the performance characteristics of nine different recovery techniques with respect to four key parameters and a set of other parameters with less influence. Finally, the results of model evaluation as well as the limitations of the models themselves are discussed.

#! This paper discusses the implementation of a database buffer manager as a component of a DBMS. The interface between calling components of higher system layers and the buffer manager is described; the principal differences between virtual memory paging and database buffer management are outlined; the notion of referencing versus addressing of database pages is introduced; and the concept of fixing pages in the buffer to prevent uncontrolled replacement is explained.Three basic tasks have to be performed by the buffer manager: buffer search, allocation of frames to concurrent transactions, and page replacement. For each of these tasks, implementation alternatives are discussed and illustrated by examples from a performance evaluation project of a CODASYL DBMS.

#! An analysis of the distributions and relationships derived from the change data collected during development of a medium-scale software project produces some surprising insights into the factors influencing software development. Among these are the tradeoffs between modifying an existing module as opposed to creating a new one, and the relationship between module size and error proneness.

#! Practical suggestions are presented for effectively managing software development in small-project environments (i.e., no more than several million dollars per year). The suggestions are based on an approach to product development using a product assurance group that is independent from the development group. Within this check-and-balance management/development/product assurance structure, a design review process is described that effects an orderly transition from customer needs statement to software code. The testing activity that follows this process is then explained. Finally, the activities of a change control body (called a configuration control board) and supporting functions geared to maintaining delivered software are described. The suggested software management practices result from the experience of a small (approximately 100 employees) software engineering company that develops and maintains computer systems supporting real-time interactive commercial, industrial, and military applications.

#! This paper presents a methodology for evaluating text editors on several dimensions: the time it takes experts to perform basic editing tasks, the time experts spend making and correcting errors, the rate at which novices learn to perform basic editing tasks, and the functionality of editors over more complex tasks. Time, errors, and learning are measured experimentally; functionality is measured analytically; time is also calculated analytically. The methodology has thus far been used to evaluate nine diverse text editors, producing an initial database of performance results. The database is used to tell us not only about the editors but also about the users—the magnitude of individual differences and the factors affecting novice learning.

#! The coalesced hashing method has been shown to be very fast for dynamic information storage and retrieval. This paper analyzes in a uniform way the performance of coalesced hashing and its variants, thus settling some open questions in the literature.In all the variants, the range of the hash function is called the address region, and extra space reserved for storing colliders is called the cellar. We refer to the unmodified method, which was analyzed previously, as late-insertion coalesced hashing. In this paper we analyze late insertion and two new variations called early insertion and varied insertion. When there is no cellar, the early-insertion method is better than late insertion; however, past experience has indicated that it might be worse when there is a cellar. Our analysis confirms that it is worse. The varied-insertion method was introduced as a means of combining the advantages of late insertion and early insertion. This paper shows that varied insertion requires fewer probes per search, on the average, than do the other variants.Each of these three coalesced hashing methods has a parameter that relates the sizes of the address region and the cellar. Techniques in this paper are designed for tuning the parameter in order to achieve optimum search times. We conclude with a list of open problems.

#! In a one-copy distributed database, each data item is stored at exactly one site. In a replicated database, some data items may be stored at multiple sites. The main motivation is improved reliability: by storing important data at multiple sites, the DBS can operate even though some sites have failed.This paper describes an algorithm for handling replicated data, which allows users to operate on data so long as one copy is “available.” A copy is “available” when (i) its site is up, and (ii) the copy is not out-of-date because of an earlier crash.The algorithm handles clean, detectable site failures, but not Byzantine failures or network partitions.

#! This paper studies the problem of storing single-level and multilevel clustered files. Necessary and sufficient conditions for a single-level clustered file to have the consecutive retrieval property (CRP) are developed. A linear time algorithm to test the CRP for a given clustered file and to identify the proper arrangement of objects, if CRP exists, is presented. For the single-level clustered files that do not have CRP, it is shown that the problem of identifying a storage organization with minimum redundancy is NP-complete.Consequently, an efficient heuristic algorithm to generate a good storage organization for such files is developed. Furthermore, it is shown that, for certain types of multilevel clustered files, there exists a storage organization such that the objects in each cluster, for all clusters in each level of the clustering, appear in consecutive locations.

#! This paper addresses the vertical partitioning of a set of logical records or a relation into fragments. The rationale behind vertical partitioning is to produce fragments, groups of attribute columns, that “closely match” the requirements of transactions.Vertical partitioning is applied in three contexts: a database stored on devices of a single type, a database stored in different memory levels, and a distributed database. In a two-level memory hierarchy, most transactions should be processed using the fragments in primary memory. In distributed databases, fragment allocation should maximize the amount of local transaction processing.Fragments may be nonoverlapping or overlapping. A two-phase approach for the determination of fragments is proposed; in the first phase, the design is driven by empirical objective functions which do not require specific cost information. The second phase performs cost optimization by incorporating the knowledge of a specific application environment. The algorithms presented in this paper have been implemented, and examples of their actual use are shown.

#! Several fairly large sets of programming rules have been developed recently. It is natural to ask whether the process of developing such rule bases may converge. Having developed sets of rules for specific programming tasks and domains, will they be helpful when other tasks and domains are considered? While it is too early to give definitive answers, experience with the rules of the PECOS system has been positive. Both during the process of developing the rule set and while developing rules for another domain, the existence of already codified rules proved very helpful.

#! A specification technique, formally equivalent to finite-state machines, is offered as an alternative because it is inherently distributed and more comprehensible. When applied to modules whose complexity is dominated by control, the technique guides the analyst to an effective decomposition of complexity, encourages well-structured error handling, and offers an opportunity for parallel computation. When applied to distributed protocols, the technique provides a unique perspective and facilitates automatic detection of some classes of error. These applications are illustrated by a controller for a distributed telephone system and the full-duplex alternating-bit protocol for data communication. Several schemes are presented for executing the resulting specifications.

#! Until recently, information-flow analysis has been used primarily to verify that information transmission between program variables cannot violate security requirements. Here, the notion of information flow is explored as an aid to program development and validation.Information-flow relations are presented for while-programs, which identify those program statements whose execution may cause information to be transmitted from or to particular input, internal, or output values. It is shown with examples how these flow relations can be helpful in writing, testing, and updating programs; they also usefully extend the class of errors which can be detected automatically in the “static analysis” of a program.

#! An efficient algorithm for communicating letter-shape information from a high-speed computer with a large memory to a typesetting device that has a limited memory is presented. The encoding is optimum, in the sense that the total time for typesetting is minimized, using a model that generalizes well-known “demand paging” strategies to the case where changes to the cache are allowed before the associated information is actually needed. Extensive empirical data show that good results are obtained even when difficult technical material is being typeset on a machine that can store information concerning only 100 characters. The methods of this paper are also applicable to other hardware and software caching applications with restricted lookahead.

#! Generative communication is the basis of a new distributed programming langauge that is intended for systems programming in distributed settings generally and on integrated network computers in particular. It differs from previous interprocess communication models in specifying that messages be added in tuple-structured form to the computation environment, where they exist as named, independent entities until some process chooses to receive them. Generative communication results in a number of distinguishing properties in the new language, Linda, that is built around it. Linda is fully distributed in space and distributed in time; it allows distributed sharing, continuation passing, and structured naming. We discuss these properties and their implications, then give a series of examples. Linda presents novel implementation problems that we discuss in Part II. We are particularly concerned with implementation of the dynamic global name space that the generative communication model requires.

#! One aspect of network design is the extent to which memory is shared among the processing elements. In this paper a model with limited sharing (only two processors connected to each memory) is analyzed and its performance compared with the performance of two other models that have appeared in the literature. One of these is a model of multiple processors sharing a single memory; the other model considers a multiprocessor configuration in which each processor has its own dedicated memory. The tasks processed by these networks are described by both time and memory requirements. The largest-memory-first (LMF) scheduling algorithm is employed and its performance with respect to an enumerative optimal scheduling algorithm is bounded. On the basis of this measure we conclude that memory sharing is only desirable on very small networks and is disadvantageous on networks of larger size.

These algorithms work in the presence of arbitrary clock or process failures, including “two-faced clocks” that present different values to different processes. Two of the algorithms require that fewer than one-third of the processes be faulty. A third algorithm works if fewer than half the processes are faulty, but requires digital signatures.

#! Three different approaches to heuristic search in networks are analyzed. In the first approach, as formulated initially by Hart, Nilsson, and Raphael, and later modified by Martelli, the basic idea is to choose for expansion that node for which the evaluation function has a minimum value. A second approach has recently been suggested by Nilsson. In this method, in contrast to the earlier one, a node that is expanded once is not expanded again; instead, a “propagation” of values takes place. The third approach is an adaptation for networks of an AND/OR graph “marking” algorithm, originally due to Martelli and Montanari.Five algorithms are presented. Algorithms A and C illustrate the first approach; PropA and PropC, the second one; and MarkA, the third one. The performances of these algorithms are compared for both admissible and inadmissible heuristics using the following two criteria: (i) cost of the solution found; (ii) time of execution in the worst case, as measured by the number of node expansions (A, C), or node “selections” (PropA, PropC), or arc “markings” (MarkA).The relative merits and demerits of the algorithms are summarized and indications are given regarding which algorithm to use in different situations.

#! Two new marking algorithms for AND/OR graphs called CF and CS are presented. For admissible heuristics CS is not needed, and CF is shown to be preferable to the marking algorithms of Martelli and Montanari. When the heuristic is not admissible, the analysis is carried out with the help of the notion of the first and second discriminants of an AND/OR graph. It is proved that in this case CF can be followed by CS to get optimal solutions, provided the sumcost criterion is used and the first discriminant equals the second. Estimates of time and storage requirements are given. Other cost measures, such as maxcost, are also considered, and a number of interesting open problems are enumerated.

#! Since a nondeterministic and concurrent program may, in general, communicate repeatedly with its environment, its meaning cannot be presented naturally as an input/output function (as is often done in the denotational approach to semantics). In this paper, an alternative is put forth. First, a definition is given of what it is for two programs or program parts to be equivalent for all observers; then two program parts are said to be observation congruent if they are, in all program contexts, equivalent. The behavior of a program part, that is, its meaning, is defined to be its observation congruence class.The paper demonstrates, for a sequence of simple languages expressing finite (terminating) behaviors, that in each case observation congruence can be axiomatized algebraically. Moreover, with the addition of recursion and another simple extension, the algebraic language described here becomes a calculus for writing and specifying concurrent programs and for proving their properties.

#! The subset sum problem is to decide whether or not the 0-l integer programming problem &Sgr;ni=l aixi = M, ∀I, xI = 0 or 1, has a solution, where the ai and M are given positive integers. This problem is NP-complete, and the difficulty of solving it is the basis of public-key cryptosystems of knapsack type. An algorithm is proposed that searches for a solution when given an instance of the subset sum problem. This algorithm always halts in polynomial time but does not always find a solution when one exists. It converts the problem to one of finding a particular short vector v in a lattice, and then uses a lattice basis reduction algorithm due to A. K. Lenstra, H. W. Lenstra, Jr., and L. Lovasz to attempt to find v. The performance of the proposed algorithm is analyzed. Let the density d of a subset sum problem be defined by d = n/log2(maxi ai). Then for “almost all” problems of density d d n, it is proved that the lattice basis reduction algorithm locates v. Extensive computational tests of the algorithm suggest that it works for densities d dc(n), where dc(n) is a cutoff value that is substantially larger than 1/n. This method gives a polynomial time attack on knapsack public-key cryptosystems that can be expected to break them if they transmit information at rates below dc(n), as n → ∞.

In particular, families defined by one join dependency and several “embedded” functional dependencies can be obtained in this manner.

#! A popular means of increasing the effective rate of main storageaccesses in a large computer is a multiplicity of memory modulesaccessible in parallel. Although such an organization usuallyachieves a net gain in access rate, it also creates new modes ofcongestion at the storage controller. This paper analyzes thevariables that describe such a congestion: queue lengths anddelays. A controller that maintains separate register sets toaccommodate the request queue of each module is considered. Thevarious processors attached to the storage are assumed to generate,in each memory cycle, a number of access requests with the samegiven distribution. The addresses specified by these requests(reduced to the module index) are further assumed to follow thestates of a first-order Markov chain. The analysis then becomes oneof a single-server queuing system with constant service time andindexed batch arrival process. Results are derived for severaldescriptors of the congestion and thus of the quality of serviceoffered by such an organization. The aim throughout is to embodythe results in a form readily suitable for numericalevaluation.

#! The traditional LALR analysis is reexamined using a new operator and an associated graph. An improved method that allows factoring out a crucial part of the computation for defining states of LR(0) canonical collection and for computing LALR(1) lookahead sets is presented. This factorization leads to significantly improved algorithms with respect to execution time as well as storage requirements. Experimental results including comparison with other known methods are presented.

#! The significant intellectual cost of programming is for problem solving and explaining, not for coding. Yet programming systems offer mechanical assistance for the coding process exclusively. We illustrate the use of an implemented program development system, called PRL ("pearl"), that provides automated assistance with the difficult part. The problem and its explained solution are seen as formal objects in a constructive logic of the data domains. These formal explanations can be executed at various stages of completion. The most incomplete explanations resemble applicative programs, the most complete are formal proofs.

#! The problem of generalizing functional specifications for while loops is considered. This problem occurs frequently when trying to verify that an initialized loop satisfies some functional specification, i.e., produces outputs which are some function of the program inputs.The notion of a valid generalization of a loop specification is defined. A particularly simple valid generalization, a base generalization, is discussed. A property of many commonly occurring while loops, that of being uniformly implemented, is defined. A technique is presented which exploits this property in order to systematically achieve a valid generalization of the loop specification. Two classes of uniformly implemented loops that are particularly susceptible to this form of analysis are defined and discussed. The use of the proposed technique is illustrated with a number of applications. Finally, an implication of the concept of uniform loop implementation for the validation of the obtained generalization is explained.

#! The most effective use of mesh-connected array processors is achieved by paying careful attention to the organization of data. Storage and movement of the elements of multidimensional arrays of data within a multidimensional store for a particular problem is a difficult task, often handled in an ad hoc way. For an important class of problems, considerable conceptual simplification arises from considering a specification of the mapping rather than the physical location of data.

#! Does Grosch's law, which postulated that the costs of computer systems increase at a rate equivalent to the square root of their power, still hold? The age of mini-, micro-, and supercomputers seems to have complicated the situation. When computers are grouped according to their size and power, Grosch's law seems to hold within each group, but not between different groups.

#! Effective development environments for discrete event simulation models should reduce development costs and improve model performance. A model specification language used in a model development environment is defined. This approach is intended to reduce modeling costs by interposing an intermediate form between a conceptual model (the model as it exists in the mind of the modeler) and an executable representation of that model. As a model specification is constructed, the incomplete specification can be analyzed to detect some types of errors and to provide some types of model documentation. The primitives used in this specification language, called a condition specification (CS), are carefully defined. A specification for the classical patrolling repairman model is used to illustrate this language. Some possible diagnostics and some untestable model specification properties, based on such a representation, are summarized.

#! In this article we study the amortized efficiency of the “move-to-front” and similar rules for dynamically maintaining a linear list. Under the assumption that accessing the ith element from the front of the list takes &thgr;(i) time, we show that move-to-front is within a constant factor of optimum among a wide class of list maintenance rules. Other natural heuristics, such as the transpose and frequency count rules, do not share this property. We generalize our results to show that move-to-front is within a constant factor of optimum as long as the access cost is a convex function. We also study paging, a setting in which the access cost is not convex. The paging rule corresponding to move-to-front is the “least recently used” (LRU) replacement rule. We analyze the amortized complexity of LRU, showing that its efficiency differs from that of the off-line paging rule (Belady's MIN algorithm) by a factor that depends on the size of fast memory. No on-line paging algorithm has better amortized performance.

#! A simple and efficient method for processing general equijoin queries in a distributed relational database is described. The query is first decomposed into a set of simple queries, each being involved with only one of the joining domains and its relevant equijoins. An extended version of Hevner and Yao's STRATEGY PARALLEL or STRATEGY SERIAL is then applied on each of them for generating transmission schedules. These schedules will fully reduce (with respect to a simple query) some specified relations. The latter are then transmitted to the result site for final processing. In the case of minimizing total time, our method has a lower order of complexity than ALGORITHM GENERAL studied by Hevner and Apers. Examples show that our method gives better and more efficient solutions than theirs.

#! The problem of synthesizing a procedure from example computations is examined. An algorithm for this task is presented, and its success is considered. To do this, a model of procedures and example computations is introduced, and the class of acceptable examples is defined. The synthesis algorithm is shown to be successful, with respect to the model of procedures and examples, from two perspectives. First, it is shown to be sound, that is, that the procedure synthesized from a set of examples produces the same result as the intended one on the inputs used to generate that set of examples. Second, it is shown to be complete, that is, that for any procedure in the class of procedures, there exists a finite set of examples such that the procedure synthesized behaves as the intended one on all inputs for which the intended one halts.

#! Many database systems maintain the consistency of the data by using a locking protocol to restrict access to data items. It has been previously shown that if no information is known about the method of accessing items in the database, then the two-phase protocol is optimal. However, the use of structural information about the database allows development of non-two-phase protocols, called graph protocols, that can potentially increase efficiency. Yannakakis developed a general class of protocols that included many of the graph protocols. Graph protocols either are only usable in certain types of databases or can incur the performance liability of cascading rollback. In this paper, it is demonstrated that if the system has a priori information as to which data items will be locked first by various transactions, a new graph protocol that is outside the previous classes of graph protocols and is applicable to arbitrarily structured databases can be constructed. This new protocol avoids cascading rollback and its accompanying performance degradation, and extends the class of serializable sequences allowed by non-two-phase protocols. This is the first protocol shown to be always as effective as the two-phase protocol, and it can be more effective for certain types of database systems.

#! This paper analyzes decomposition properties of a graph that, when they occur, permit a polynomial solution of the traveling salesman problem and a description of the traveling salesman polytope by a system of linear equalities and inequalities. The central notion is that of a 3-edge cutset, namely, a set of 3 edges that, when removed, disconnects the graph. Conversely, our approach can be used to construct classes of graphs for which there exists a polynomial algorithm for the traveling salesman problem. The approach is illustrated on two examples, Halin graphs and prismatic graphs.

#! Criteria for adequacy of a data flow semantics are discussed and Kahn's successful semantics for functional (deterministic) data flow is reviewed. Problems arising from nondeterminism are introduced and the paper's approach to overcoming them is introduced. The approach is based on generalizing the notion of input-output relation, essentially to a partially ordered multiset of input-output histories. The Brock-Ackerman anomalies concerning the input-output relation model of nondeterministic data flow are reviewed, and it is indicated how the proposed approach avoids them. A new anomaly is introduced to motivate the use of multisets. A formal theory of asynchronous processes is then developed. The main result is that the operation of forming a process from a network of component processes is associative. This result shows that the approach is not subject to anomalies such as that of Brock and Ackerman.

#! A distributed computer system that consists of a set of heterogeneous host computers connected in an arbitrary fashion by a communications network is considered. A general model is developed for such a distributed computer system, in which the host computers and the communications network are represented by product-form queuing networks. In this model, a job may be either processed at the host to which it arrives or transferred to another host. In the latter case, a transferred job incurs a communication delay in addition to the queuing delay at the host on which the job is processed. It is assumed that the decision of transferring a job does not depend on the system state, and hence is static in nature. Performance is optimized by determining the load on each host that minimizes the mean job response time. A nonlinear optimization problem is formulated, and the properties of the optimal solution in the special case where the communication delay does not depend on the source-destination pair is shown.Two efficient algorithms that determine the optimal load on each host computer are presented. The first algorithm, called the parametric-study algorithm, generates the optimal solution as a function of the communication time. This algorithm is suited for the study of the effect of the speed of the communications network on the optimal solution. The second algorithm is a single-point algorithm; it yields the optimal solution for given system parameters. Queuing models of host computers, communications networks, and a numerical example are illustrated.

Two of the most powerful classes of programs for which interesting decision problems are known to be solvable are the class of finite-memory programs and the class of programs that characterize the Presburger, or semilinear, sets. In this paper, a new class of programs that presents solvable decision problems similar to the other two classes of programs is introduced. However, the programs in the new class are shown to be computationally more powerful (i.e., capable of defining larger sets of input-output relations).

#! A projection of a Boolean function is a function obtained by substituting for each of its variables a variable, the negation of a variable, or a constant. Reducibilities among computational problems under this relation of projection are considered. It is shown that much of what is of everyday relevance in Turing-machine-based complexity theory can be replicated easily and naturally in this elementary framework. Finer distinctions about the computational relationships among natural problems can be made than in previous formulations and some negative results are proved.

#! The problem of finding a minimum cardinality feedback vertex set of a directed graph is considered. Of the classic NP-complete problems, this is one of the least understood. Although Karp showed the general problem to be NP-complete, a linear algorithm for its solution on reducible flow graphs was given by Shamir. The class of reducible flow graphs is the only nontrivial class of graphs for which a polynomial-time algorithm to solve this problem is known. The main result of this paper is to present a new class of graphs—the cyclically reducible graphs—for which minimum feedback vertex sets can be found in polynomial time. This class is not restricted to flow graphs, and most small graphs (10 or fewer nodes) fall into this class. The identification of this class is particularly important since there do not exist approximation algorithms for this problem having a provably good worst case performance. Along with the class and a simple polynomial-time algorithm for finding minimum feedback vertex sets of graphs in the class, several related results are presented. It is shown that there is no “forbidden subgraph” characterization of the class and that there is no particular inclusion relationship between this class and the reducible flow graphs. In addition, it is shown that a class of (general) graphs, which are related to the reducible flow graphs, are contained in the cyclically reducible class.

#! Given the pairwise probability of conflict p among transactions in a transaction processing system, together with the total number of concurrent transactions n, the effective level of concurrency E(n,p) is defined as the expected number of the n transactions that can run concurrently and actually do useful work. Using a random graph model of concurrency, we show for three general classes of concurrency control methods, examples of which are (1) standard locking, (2) strict priority scheduling, and (3) optimistic methods, that (1) E(n, p) &les; n(1 - p/2)n-1, (2) E(n, p) &les; (1 - (1 - p)n)/p, and (3) 1 + ((1 - p)/p)ln(p(n - 1) + 1) &les; E(n, p) &les; 1 + (1/p)ln(p(n - 1) + 1). Thus, for fixed p, as n &rarrtl; ∞), (1) E &rarrtl; 0 for standard locking methods, (2) E &les; 1/p for strict priority scheduling methods, and (3) E &rarrtl; ∞ for optimistic methods. Also found are bounds on E in the case where conflicts are analyzed so as to maximize E.The predictions of the random graph model are confirmed by simulations of an abstract transaction processing system. In practice, though, there is a price to pay for the increased effective level of concurrency of methods (2) and (3): using these methods there is more wasted work (i.e., more steps executed by transactions that are later aborted). In response to this problem, three new concurrency control methods suggested by the random graph model analysis are developed. Two of these, called (a) running priority and (b) older or running priority, are shown by the simulation results to perform better than the previously known methods (l)-(3) for relatively large n or large p, in terms of achieving a high effective level of concurrency at a comparatively small cost in wasted work.

#! In a distributed database system the partitioning and allocation of the database over the processor nodes of the network can be a critical aspect of the database design effort. In this paper we develop and evaluate algorithms that perform this task in a computationally feasible manner. The network we consider is characterized by a relatively high communication bandwidth, considering the processing and input output capacities in its processors. Such a balance is typical if the processors are connected via busses or local networks. The common constraint that transactions have a specific root node no longer exists, so that there are more distribution choices. However, a poor distribution leads to less efficient computation, higher costs, and higher loads in the nodes or in the communication network so that the system may not be able to handle the required set of transactions.Our approach is to first split the database into fragments which constitute appropriate units for allocation. The fragments to be allocated are selected based on maximal benefit criteria using a greedy heuristic. The assignment to processor nodes uses a first-fit algorithm. The complete algorithm, called GFF, is stated in a procedural form.The complexity of the problem and of its candidate solutions are analyzed and several interesting relationships are proven. Alternate benefit metrics are considered, since the execution cost of the allocation procedure varies by orders of magnitude with the alternatives of benefit evaluation. A mixed benefit evaluation strategy is eventually proposed.A model for evaluation is presented. Two of the strategies are experimentally evaluated, and the reported results support the discussion. The approach should be suitable for other cases where resources have to be allocated subject to resource constraints.

Because of the need to interface with the rest of the MPS this implementation is unorthodox, but computationally effective, and has a number of advantages over “stand alone” network optimizers. It is argued that a similar approach is appropriate for other general-purpose mathematical programming systems, and has applications beyond pure network optimization.

Our testing procedure can he useful for developing new algorithms and for writing and evaluating optimization software.We use the method to compare two versions of the conjugate gradient algorithm, and to compare these with an algorithm based on conic functions.

#! We introduce fast algorithms for selecting a random sample of n records without replacement from a pool of N records, where the value of N is unknown beforehand. The main result of the paper is the design and analysis of Algorithm Z; it does the sampling in one pass using constant space and in O(n(1 + log(N/n))) expected time, which is optimum, up to a constant factor. Several optimizations are studied that collectively improve the speed of the naive version of the algorithm by an order of magnitude. We give an efficient Pascal-like implementation that incorporates these modifications and that is suitable for general use. Theoretical and empirical results indicate that Algorithm Z outperforms current methods by a significant margin.

#! Computer science in secondary schools is an area of increasing interest and concern to educators as well as to computer science professionals. Each of the next two reports addresses an issue of major importance regarding computer science in secondary schools. The first report recommends computer science courses for the secondary school curriculum, and the second report recommends requirements for teacher certification in computer science.In 1983 the ACM Education Board initiated efforts to formulate recommendations for secondary school computer science. Two task forces, one for curriculum recommendations and the other for teacher certification recommendations, were established under the Education Board's Elementary and Secondary Schools Subcommittee. The work of the two task forces was also supported by the IEEE Computer Society Educational Activities Board, and the final reports from the task forces were jointly approved by the ACM and IEEE-CS boards in July 1984. Thus the reports are significan't not only for the important issues that they address, but also because they represent a joint activity between ACM and the IEEE Computer Society.The work of the two task forces is summarized in the next two reports. The full reports are available as the publication Computer Science in Secondary Schools: Curriculum and Teacher Certification, Order Number 201850, from the ACM Order Department, P.O.

#! This article is both theoretical and empirical. Theoretically, it describes three principles of system design which we believe must be followed to produce a useful and easy to use computer system. These principles are: early and continual focus on users; empirical measurement of usage; and iterative design whereby the system (simulated, prototype, and real) is modified, tested, modified again, tested again, and the cycle is repeated again and again. This approach is contrasted to other principled design approaches, for example, get it right the first time, reliance on design guidelines. Empirically, the article presents data which show that our design principles are not always intuitive to designers; identifies the arguments which designers often offer for not using these principles—and answers them; and provides an example in which our principles have been used successfully.

#! A major issue in many applications is how to preserve the consistency of data in the presence of concurrency and hardware failures. We suggest addressing this problem by implementing applications in terms of abstract data types with two properties: Their objects are atomic (they provide serializability and recoverability for activities using them) and resilient (they survive hardware failures with acceptably high probability). We define what it means for abstract data types to be atomic and resilient. We also discuss issues that arise in implementing such types, and describe a particular linguistic mechanism provided in the Argus programming language.

#! This paper presents a new model for exception handling, called the replacement model. The replacement model, in contrast to other exception-handling proposals, supports all the handler responses of resumption, termination, retry, and exception propagation, within both statements and expressions, in a modular, simple, and uniform fashion. The model can be embedded in any expression-oriented language and can also be adapted to languages which are not expression oriented with almost all the above advantages. This paper presents the syntactic extensions for embedding the replacement model into Algol 68 and its operational semantics. An axiomatic semantic definition for the model can be found in [27].

#! Most programming environments are much too complex. One way of simplifying them is to reduce the number of mode-dependent languages the user has to be familiar with. As a first step towards this end, the feasibility of unified command/programming/debugging languages, and the concepts on which such languages have to be based, are investigated. The unification process is accomplished in two phases. First, a unified command/programming framework is defined and, second, this framework is extended by adding an integrated debugging capability to it. Strict rules are laid down by which to judge language concepts presenting themselves as candidates for inclusion in the framework during each phase. On the basis of these rules many of the language design questions that have hitherto been resolved this way or that, depending on the taste of the designer, lose their vagueness and can be decided in an unambiguous manner.

#! The CIRCAL calculus is presented as a mathematical framework in which to describe and analyze concurrent systems, whether hardware or software.The dot operator is used to compose CIRCAL descriptions, and it is this operator which permits the natural modeling of asynchronous and simultaneous behavior, thus allowing the representation and analysis of system timing properties such as those found in circuits.The CIRCAL framework uses an abstraction operator to permit the modeling of a system at different levels of detail. Behavioral complexity of real systems makes abstraction crucial when producing a tractable model, and we illustrate how abstraction introduces nondeterminisim into system representations.An operational semantics, acceptance semantics, is introduced, and it is in terms of this active experimentation that meaning is given to the CIRCAL syntax, thus allowing proof of system properties to be constructed.

#! Sufficient criteria are given for replacing all occurrences of the store argument in a Scott-Strachey denotational definition of a programming language by a single global variable. The criteria and transformation are useful for transforming denotational definitions into compilers and interpreters for imperative machines, for optimizing applicative programs, and for judging the suitability of semantic notations for describing imperative languages. An example transformation of a semantics of a repeat-loop language to one which uses a global store variable is given to illustrate the technique.

#! Linear hashing is a file structure for dynamic files. In this paper, a new, simple method for handling overflow records in connection with linear hashing is proposed. The method is based on linear probing and does not rely on chaining. No dedicated overflow area is required. The expansion sequence of liner hashing is modified to improve the performance, which requires changes in the address computation. A new address computation algorithm and an expansion algorithm are given. The performance of the method is studied by simulation. The algorithms for the basic file operations are very simple, and the overall performance is competitive with that of other variants of linear hashing.

#! A graph model is presented to analyze the performance of a relational join. The amount of page reaccesses, the page access sequence, and the amount of buffer needed are represented in terms of graph parameters. By using the graph model formed from the index on the join attributes, we determine the relationships between these parameters. Two types of buffer allocation strategies are studied, and the upper bound on the buffer size with no page reaccess is given. This bound is shown to be the maximum cut value of a graph. Hence, the problem of computing this upper bound is NP-hard. We also give algorithms to determine a page access sequence requiring a near optimal buffer size with no page reaccess. The optimal page access sequence for a fixed buffer size has also been considered.

A direct and simple expression is developed for computing the average number of records/pages accessed to satisfy a batched query of a sequential tile. The advantages of batching for sequential and random files are discussed. A direct equation is provided for the number of nodes accessed in unhatched queries of hierarchical files. An exact recursive expression is developed for node accesses in batched queries of hierarchical files. In addition to the recursive relationship, good, closed-form upper- and lower-bound approximations are provided for the case of batched queries of hierarchical files.

#! Database system support has become an essential part of many computer applications, which have extended beyond the more traditional commercial applications to, among others, engineering applications. Correspondingly, application programming with the need to access databases has progressively shifted to scientifically oriented languages.Modern developments in these languages are characterized by advanced mechanisms for the liberal declaration of data types, for type checking, and facilities for modularization of large programs. The present paper examines how a DBMS can be accessed from such a language in a way that conforms to its syntax and utilizes its type-checking facilities, without modifying the language specification itself, and hence its compilers. The basic idea is to rely on facilities for defining modules as separately compilable units, and to use these to declare user-defined abstract data types.The idea is demonstrated by an experiment in which a specific DBMS (ADABAS) is hosted in the programming language (LIS). The paper outlines a number of approaches and their problems, shows how to embed the DML into LIS, and how a more user-oriented DML can be provided in LIS.

#! The performance of sequential search can be enhanced by the use of heuristics that move elements closer to the front of the list as they are found. Previous analyses have characterized the performance of such heuristics probabilistically. In this article, we use amortization to analyze the heuristics in a worst-case sense; the relative merit of the heuristics in this analysis is different in the probabilistic analyses. Experiments show that the behavior of the heuristics on real data is more closely described by the amortized analyses than by the probabilistic analyses.

Finally, some computational results and remarks on the practical relevance of improved implicit enumeration algorithms are given.

#! Given a general arithmetic expression, we find a computation binary tree representation in O(log n) time using n/log n processors on a concurrent-read, exclusive-write, parallel random-access machine.A new algorithm is introduced for this purpose. Unlike previous serial and parallel solutions, it is not based on using a stack.

POINTY combines an interactive programming environment with the teaching-by-guiding methodology that has been successful in industrial robotics. Owing to its ability to control robots in real time, and to interact with the user, POINTY provides a friendly and powerful programming environment for robot applications. In the past few years, POINTY has been in use at Stanford to write, test, and debug various robot programs.

We describe a program transformation technique for programs in a general stream language L whereby a data-driven evaluation of the transformed program performs exactly the same computation as a demand-driven evaluation of the original program. The transformational technique suggests a simple denotational characterization of demand-driven evaluation.

#! An empirical study of 282 users of home computers was conducted to explore the relationship between computer use and shifts in time allocation patterns in the household. Major changes in time allocated to various activities were detected. Prior experience with computers (i.e., prior to purchase of the home computer) was found to have a significant impact on the time allocation patterns in the household. The study provides evidence that significant behavior changes can occur when people adopt personal computers in their homes.

#! A perfect hash function PHF is an injection F from a set W of M objects into the set consisting of the first N nonnegative integers where N &ges; M. If N = M, then F is a minimal perfect hash function, MPHF. PHFs are useful for the compact storage and fast retrieval of frequently used objects such as reserved words in a programming language or commonly employed words in a natural language.The mincycle algorithm for finding PHFs executes with an expected time complexity that is polynomial in M and has been used successfully on sets of cardinality up to 512. Given three pseudorandom functions h0, h1, and h2, the mincycle algorithm searches for a function g such that F(w) = (h0(w) + g ° h1(w) + g ° h2(w)) mod N is a PHF.

#! A voice interactive natural language system, which allows users to solve problems with spoken English commands, has been constructed. The system utilizes a commercially available discrete speech recognizer which requires that each word be followed by approximately a 300 millisecond pause. In a test of the system, subjects were able to learn its use after about two hours of training. The system correctly processed about 77 percent of the over 6000 input sentences spoken in problem-solving sessions. Subjects spoke at the rate of about three sentences per minute and were able to effectively use the system to complete the given tasks. Subjects found the system relatively easy to learn and use, and gave a generally positive report of their experience.

#! In a nonnegative edge-weighted network, the weight of an edge represents the effort required by an attacker to destroy the edge, and the attacker derives a benefit for each new component created by destroying edges. The attacker may want to minimize over subsets of edges the difference between (or the ratio of) the effort incurred and the benefit received. This idea leads to the definition of the “strength” of the network, a measure of the resistance of the network to such attacks. Efficient algorithms for the optimal attack problem, the problem of computing the strength, and the problem of finding a minimum cost “reinforcement” to achieve a desired strength are given. These problems are also solved for a different model, in which the attacker wants to separate vertices from a fixed central vertex.

#! This paper reports several properties of heuristic best-first search strategies whose scoring functions ƒ depend on all the information available from each candidate path, not merely on the current cost g and the estimated completion cost h. It is shown that several known properties of A* retain their form (with the minmax of f playing the role of the optimal cost), which helps establish general tests of admissibility and general conditions for node expansion for these strategies. On the basis of this framework the computational optimality of A*, in the sense of never expanding a node that can be skipped by some other algorithm having access to the same heuristic information that A* uses, is examined. A hierarchy of four optimality types is defined and three classes of algorithms and four domains of problem instances are considered. Computational performances relative to these algorithms and domains are appraised. For each class-domain combination, we then identify the strongest type of optimality that exists and the algorithm for achieving it. The main results of this paper relate to the class of algorithms that, like A*, return optimal solutions (i.e., admissible) when all cost estimates are optimistic (i.e., h ≤ h*). On this class, A* is shown to be not optimal and it is also shown that no optimal algorithm exists, but if the performance tests are confirmed to cases in which the estimates are also consistent, then A* is indeed optimal. Additionally, A* is also shown to be optimal over a subset of the latter class containing all best-first algorithms that are guided by path-dependent evaluation functions.

#! A new performance model for dynamic locking is proposed. It is based on a flow diagram and uses only the steady state average values of the variables. It is general enough to handle nonuniform access, shared locks, static locking, multiple transaction classes, and transactions of indeterminate length. The analysis is restricted to the case in which all conflicts are resolved by restarts. It has been shown elsewhere that, under certain conditions, this pure restart policy is as good as, if not better than, a policy that uses both blocking and restarts.The analysis is straightforward, and the computational complexity of the solution, given some nonrestrictive approximations, does not depend on the input parameters. The solution is also well defined and well behaved. The model's predictions agree well with simulation results.The model shows that data contention can cause the throughput to thrash, and gives a limit on the workload that will prevent this. It also shows that systems with a particular kind of nonuniform access and systems in which transactions share locks are equivalent to systems in which there is uniform access and only exclusive locking. Static locking has higher throughput, but longer response time, than dynamic locking. Replacing updates by queries in a multiprogramming mix may degrade performance if the queries are longer than the updates.

For all classes of structured flowcharts considered, the number of charts is approximately, cn-3/2&ggr;n, for large n, where cand &ggr; are parameters that depend on the class. It is also shown that most large flowcharts consist of a short sequence of basic charts (IF-THEN-ELSE and DO-WHILE charts). The average length of such sequences is 2.5.

Also shown is that 1.691 … is a lower bound for all 0(1)-space on-line bin-packing algorithms.

#! A new model of computation for VLSI, based on the assumption that time for propagating information is at least linear in the distance, is proposed. While accommodating for basic laws of physics, the model is designed to be general and technology independent. Thus, from a complexity viewpoint, it is especially suited for deriving lower bounds and trade-offs. New results for a number of problems, including fan-in, transitive functions, matrix multiplication, and sorting are presented. As regards upper bounds, it must be noted that, because of communication costs, the model clearly favors regular and pipelined architectures (e.g., systolic arrays).

#! The splay tree, a self-adjusting form of binary search tree, is developed and analyzed. The binary search tree is a data structure for representing tables and lists so that accessing, inserting, and deleting items is easy. On an n-node splay tree, all the standard search tree operations have an amortized time bound of O(log n) per operation, where by “amortized time” is meant the time per operation averaged over a worst-case sequence of operations. Thus splay trees are as efficient as balanced trees when total running time is the measure of interest. In addition, for sufficiently long access sequences, splay trees are as efficient, to within a constant factor, as static optimum search trees. The efficiency of splay trees comes not from an explicit structural constraint, as with balanced trees, but from applying a simple restructuring heuristic, called splaying, whenever the tree is accessed. Extensions of splaying give simplified forms of two other data structures: lexicographic or multidimensional search trees and link/cut trees.

In this paper, we show that, for any open-address hashing scheme, the expected cost of retrieving a record from a large table that is &agr;-fraction full is at least (1/&agr;) log (1/(1 - &agr;)) + o(1). This proves Ullman's conjecture to be true in the asymptotic sense.

#! This work generalizes decision trees in order to study lower bounds on the running times of algorithms that allow probabilistic, nondeterministic, or alternating control. It is shown that decision trees that are allowed internal randomization (at the expense of introducing a small probability of error) run no faster asymptotically than ordinary decision trees for a collection of natural problems. Two geometric techniques from the literature for proving lower bounds on the time required by ordinary decision trees are shown to be special cases of one unified technique that, in fact, applies to nondeterministic decision trees as well. Finally, it is shown that any lower bound on alternating decision tree time also applies to alternating Turing machine time.

#! A database is said to allow range restrictions if one may request that only records with some specified field in a specified range be considered when answering a given query. A transformation is presented that enables range restrictions to be added to an arbitrary dynamic data structure on n elements, provided that the problem satisfies a certain decomposability condition and that one is willing to allow increases by a factor of O(log n) in the worst-case time for an operation and in the space used. This is a generalization of a known transformation that works for static structures. This transformation is then used to produce a data structure for range queries in k dimensions with worst-case times of O(logk n) for each insertion, deletion, or query operation.

#! We study restricted classes of B-trees, called H(&bgr;, &ggr;, &dgr;) trees. A class is defined by three parameters: &bgr;, the size of a node; &ggr;, the minimal number of grandsons a node must have; and &dgr;, the minimal number of leaves bottom nodes must have. This generalizes the brother condition of 2-3 brother trees in a uniform way to B-trees of higher order. The class of B-trees of order m is obtained by choosing &bgr; = m, &ggr; = (m/2)2 and &dgr; = m/2. An algorithm to construct H-trees for any given number of keys is given in Section 1. Insertion and deletion algorithms are given in Section 2. The costs of these algorithms increase smoothly as the parameters are increased. Furthermore, it is proved that the insertion can be done in time O(&bgr; + log N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree. Deletion can also be accomplished without reconstructing the entire tree. Properties of H-trees are given in Section 3. It is shown that the height of H-trees decreases as &ggr; increases, and the storage utilization increases significantly as &dgr; increases. Finally, comparisons with other restricted classes of B-trees are given in Section 4 to show the attractiveness of H-trees.

The main contributions of Galileo are (a) a flexible type system to model database structure and semantic integrity constraints; (b) the inclusion of type hierarchies to support the specialization abstraction mechanisms of semantic data models; (c) a modularization mechanism to structure data and operations into interrelated units (d) the integration of abstraction mechanisms into an expression-based language that allows interactive use of the database without resorting to a new stand-alone query language.Galileo will be used in the immediate future as a tool for database design and, in the long term, as a high-level interface for DBMSs.

#! We propose a new class of schedulers, called cautious schedulers, that grant an input request if it will not necessitate any rollback in the future. In particular, we investigate cautious WRW-schedulers that output schedules in class WRW only. Class WRW consists of all schedules that are serializable, while preserving the write-read and read-write conflict, and is the largest polynomially recognizable subclass of serializable schedules currently known. It is shown, in this paper however, that cautious WRW-scheduling is, in general, NP-complete. Therefore, we introduce a special type (type 1R) of transaction, which consists of no more than one read step (an indivisible set of read operations) followed by multiple write steps. It is shown that cautious WRW-scheduling can be performed efficiently if all transactions are of type 1R and if admission control can be exercised. Admission control rejects a transaction unless its first request is immediately grantable.

#! An algorithm for record clustering is presented. It is capable of detecting sudden changes in users' access patterns and then suggesting an appropriate assignment of records to blocks. It is conceptually simple, highly intuitive, does not need to classify queries into types, and avoids collecting individual query statistics. Experimental results indicate that it converges rapidly; its performance is about 50 percent better than that of the total sort method, and about 100 percent better than that of randomly assigning records to blocks.

#! We introduce the notion of an I/O interface for optical digital (write-once) disks, which is quite different from earlier research. The purpose of an I/O interface is to allow existing operating systems and application programs that use magnetic disks to use optical disks instead, with minimal change. We define what it means for an I/O interface to be disk-efficient. We demonstrate a practical disk- efficient I/O interface and show that its I/O performance in many cases is optimum, up to a constant factor, among all disk-efficient interfaces. The interface is most effective for applications that are not update-intensive. An additional capability is a built-in history mechanism that provides software support for accessing previous versions of records. Even if not implemented, the I/O interface can be used as a programming tool to develop efficient special purpose applications for use with optical disks.

We show that update costs have a considerable influence, both in the context of the physical database design problem and in access path selection in query optimization for relational DBMSs.

We describe a prototype electronic encyclopedia implemented on a powerful personal computer, in which user interface, media presentation, and knowledge representation techniques are applied to improving access to a knowledge resource. In itself, an electronic encyclopedia is an important information resource, but this work also illustrates the issues and approaches for many types of electronic information retrieval environments. In the prototype we make dynamic use of the structure and semantics of the text articles and index of an existing encyclopedia, while experimenting with other forms of representation, such as simulation and videodisc images. We present a long-term vision of an intelligent user-interface agent; summarize previous work related to futuristic encyclopedias, electronic books, decision support systems, and knowledge libraries; and outline current and potential research directions.

#! Local area networks are becoming widely used as the database communication framework for sophisticated information systems. Databases can be distributed among stations on a network to achieve the advantages of performance, reliability, availability, and modularity. Efficient distributed query optimization algorithms are presented here for two types of local area networks: address ring networks and broadcast networks. Optimal algorithms are designed for simple queries. Optimization principles from these algorithms guide the development of effective heuristic algorithms for general queries on both types of networks. Several examples illustrate distributed query processing on local area networks.

#! Nine participants used a full-screen computer text editor (XEDIT) with an IBM 3277 terminal to edit marked-up documents at each of three cursor speeds (3.3, 4.7, and 11.0 cm/s). These speeds occur when a user continuously holds down an arrow key to move the cursor more than one character position (i.e., in repeat or typamatic mode). Results show that cursor speed did not seem to act as a pacing device for the entire editing task. Since cursor speed is a form of system response, this finding is in contrast with the generally found positive relation between system-response time and user-response time. Participants preferred the Fast cursor speed, however. Overall, more than one-third of all keystrokes were used to move the cursor. We estimate that 9-14 percent of editing time was spent controlling and moving the cursor, regardless of cursor speed.

This paper describes a survey of office workers, carried out to examine their use both of paper calendars and of electronic calendars that are commercially available as part of integrated office systems. It assesses the degree to which electronic calendars meet the needs of users. Our survey shows that the simple paper calendar is a tool whose power and flexibility is matched by few, if any, of the current commercially available electronic calendars. Recommendations for features that should be included in electronic calendars and automatic schedulers are included.

#! This article tests two competing theories of system development referred to here as environmental and institutional models. These models form the basis for most explanations of why systems are developed and utilized. We will examine both models in detail and apply them to a single set of data concerned with the emerging national computerized criminal history system (CCH). A hybrid model, which combines elements of environmental and institutional approaches, is also developed and tested. A substantive result of this new model will alter our understanding of why a national CCH system is being developed. At the theoretical level, we conclude that a hybrid model is more powerful than either an environmental or an institutional model taken separately and that future research must take this into account.

#! The transient probabilistic structure of M/Em/1 and Em/M/1 queues initialized in an arbitrary deterministic state is derived in discrete time. Computational algorithms for obtaining the required probabilities are provided, and their application in calculating a variety of system performance measures is illustrated. The results are used to investigate the question of initializing simulations of systems such as these to promote rapid convergence to steady state, if that is the object of the simulation. These results are consistent with earlier studies for transient queueing systems, such as the M/M/s, but allow greater flexibility in specification of interarrival or service-time models inherent in the Erlang distributions.

#* Efficient Computing of Relational Algebraic Primitives in a Database Machine Architecture
#@ Yang-Chang Hong
#t 1985
#c IEEE Transactions on Computers
#! Algorithms are described and analyzed for the efficient evaluation of the primitive operators of a relational algebra on a database machine architecture. The architecture contains a RAM divided up into partitions, each partition having a separate server. Tuples from the first operand relation are stored in linked lists in the partitioned RAM via bit and pointer arrays based on hashed column values. Each tuple in the second operand relation is either deposited in the corresponding partition server queue based on the hashed value, or it is ignored. Cross-referencing involved in the operations is removed without performing a sorting operation, which significantly reduces the time complexity. A procedure is also presented for computing the optimal number of partition servers for different applications.

#! In order to remain tractable, mhany reliability models do not include the states and transitions necessary to represent fault/error-handling details. Instead, the effectiveness of fault/ error-handling mechanisms is represented by the use of instantaneous coverage probabilities. This paper investigates the effect of the error introduced by the assumption of instantaneous coverage probabilities on the predictions of the reliability model, and it shows that the reliability estimates thus obtained are lower bounds on the reliability estimates of the composite model with embedded fault/error-handling states and transitions. The paper also discusses the choice of the calculation method for the instantaneous coverage probabilities and defines a near-coincident-fault coverage model that yields conservative instantaneous coverage probabilities.

#* Process Scheduling in a Computer System
#@ Zvi Rosberg
#t 1985
#c IEEE Transactions on Computers
#! A computer system is modeled by an exponential queueing network with different classes of customers and a general class of service policies. The mean cost per unit time is taken as the loss function. Three lower bounds of the loss function under the whole class of service policies, as well as an upper bound of the minimal loss, are derived. The loss function is expressed in a convenient form from which we derive a simple heuristic service policy so called "Klimov policy." This policy is applied to several examples of computer systems and is evaluated by the bounds. The examples recommend using "Klimov policy" in any case; so we have a first rule for deciding how to provide service capacity to different customers in a network of queues.

#* Efficient Implementations of the Chinese Remainder Theorem for Sign Detection and Residue Decoding
#@ Thu V. Vu
#t 1985
#c IEEE Transactions on Computers
#! Two conversion techniques based on the Chinese remainder theorem are developed for use in residue number systems. The new implementations are fast and simple mainly because adders modulo a large and arbitrary integer M are effectively replaced by binary adders and possibly a lookup table of small address space. Although different in form, both techniques share the same principle that an appropriate representation of the summands must be employed in order to evaluate a sum modulo M efficiently. The first technique reduces the sum modulo M in the conversion formula to a sum modulo 2 through the use of fractional representation, which also exposes the sign bit of numbers. Thus, this technique is particularly useful for sign detection and for any operation requiring a comparison with a binary fraction of M. The other technique is preferable for the full conversion from residues to unsigned or 2's complement integers. By expressing the summands in terms of quotients and remainders with respect to a properly chosen divisor, the second technique systematically replaces the sum modulo M by two binary sums, one accumulating the quotients modulo a power of 2 and the other accumulating the remainders the ordinary way. A final recombination step is required but is easily implemented with a small lookup table and binary adders.

The TQA system falls into the class of multilayered natural language processing systems. As a result, there is a large number of potential points at which customization to a particular database can be done. Of these, we discuss procedures that affect the reader, the lexicon, the lowest level of grammar rules, the semantic interpreter, and the output formatter. Our tests lead us to believe that the approach we are taking will make it possible for database administrators to generate robust English interfaces to particular databases without help from linguistic experts.

#! Program transformations are frequently performed by optimizing compilers, and the correctness of applying them usually depends on data flow information. For language-to-same-language transformations, it is shown how a denotational setting can be useful for validating such program transformations.Strong equivalence is obtained for transformations that exploit information from a class of forward data flow analyses, whereas only weak equivalence is obtained for transformations that exploit information from a class of backward data flow analyses. To obtain strong equivalence, both the original and the transformed program must be data flow analysed, but consideration of a transformation-exploiting liveness of variables indicates that a more satisfactory approach may be possible.

#! Analytic models based on closed queuing networks (CQNS) are widely used for performance prediction in practical systems. In using such models, there is always a prediction error, that is, a difference between the predicted performance and the actual outcome. This prediction error is due both to modeling errors and estimation errors, the latter being the difference between the estimated values of the CQN parameters and the actual outcomes. This paper considers the second class of errors; in particular, it studies the effect of small estimation errors and provides bounds on prediction errors based on bounds on estimation errors. Estimation errors may be divided into two types: (1) the difference between the estimated value and the average value of the outcome, and (2) the deviation of the actual value from its average. The analysis first studies the sum of both types of errors, then the second type alone. The results are illustrated with three examples.

#! The current trend of computer system technology is toward CPUs with rapidly increasing processing power and toward disk drives of rapidly increasing density, but with disk performance increasing very slowly if at all. The implication of these trends is that at some point the processing power of computer systems will be limited by the throughput of the input/output (I/O) system.A solution to this problem, which is described and evaluated in this paper, is disk cache. The idea is to buffer recently used portions of the disk address space in electronic storage. Empirically, it is shown that a large (e.g., 80-90 percent) fraction of all I/O requests are captured by a cache of an 8-Mbyte order-of-magnitude size for our workload sample. This paper considers a number of design parameters for such a cache (called cache disk or disk cache), including those that can be examined experimentally (cache location, cache size, migration algorithms, block sizes, etc.) and others (access time, bandwidth, multipathing, technology, consistency, error recovery, etc.) for which we have no relevant data or experiments. Consideration is given to both caches located in the I/O system, as with the storage controller, and those located in the CPU main memory. Experimental results are based on extensive trace-driven simulations using traces taken from three large IBM or IBM-compatible mainframe data processing installations. We find that disk cache is a powerful means of extending the performance limits of high-end computer systems.

#! Optimistic Recovery is a new technique supporting application-independent transparent recovery from processor failures in distributed systems. In optimistic recovery communication, computation and checkpointing proceed asynchronously. Synchronization is replaced by causal dependency tracking, which enables a posteriori reconstruction of a consistent distributed system state following a failure using process rollback and message replay.Because there is no synchronization among computation, communication, and checkpointing, optimistic recovery can tolerate the failure of an arbitrary number of processors and yields better throughput and response time than other general recovery techniques whenever failures are infrequent.

#! Quadtree representation of two-dimensional objects is performed with a tree that describes the recursive subdivision of the more complex parts of a picture until the desired resolution is reached. At the end, all the leaves of the tree are square cells that lie completely inside or outside the object. There are two great disadvantages in the use of quadtrees as a representation scheme for objects in geometric modeling system: The amount of memory required for polygonal objects is too great, and it is difficult to recompute the boundary representation of the object after some Boolean operations have been performed. In the present paper a new class of quadtrees, in which nodes may contain zero or one edge, is introduced. By using these quadtrees, storage requirements are reduced and it is possible to obtain the exact backward conversion to boundary representation. Algorithms for the generation of the quadtree, Boolean operations, and recomputation of the boundary representation are presented, and their complexities in time and space are discussed. Three-dimensional algorithms working on octrees are also presented. Their use in the geometric modeling of three-dimensional polyhedral objects is discussed.

The new algorithm is shown to achieve perfect accuracy and, depending on the underlying processor, may be faster than the fixed-point algorithm.

#! We examine methods of implementing queries about relational databases in the case where these queries are expressed in first-order logic as a collection of Horn clauses. Because queries may be defined recursively, straightforward methods of query evaluation do not always work, and a variety of strategies have been proposed to handle subsets of recursive queries. We express such query evaluation techniques as “capture rules” on a graph representing clauses and predicates. One essential property of capture rules is that they can be applied independently, thus providing a clean interface for query-evaluation systems that use several different strategies in different situations. Another is that there be an efficient test for the applicability of a given rule. We define basic capture rules corresponding to application of operators from relational algebra, a top-down capture rule corresponding to “backward chaining,” that is, repeated resolution of goals, a bottom-up rule, corresponding to “forward chaining,” where we attempt to deduce all true facts in a given class, and a “sideways” rule that allows us to pass results from one goal to another.

#! This paper presents a discussion of the techniques developed and problems encountered during the design, implementation, and experimental use of a portable natural language processor. Datalog (for “database dialogue") is an experimental natural language query system, which was designed to achieve a maximum degree of portability and extendibility. Datalog uses a three-level architecture to provide both portability of syntax to new and extended tasks and portability of semantics to new database applications. The implementation of each of the three levels, the structures and conventions that control the interactions among them, and the way in which different aspects of the design contribute to portability are described. Finally, two specific, implemented examples are presented, showing how it was possible to transport or extend Datalog by changing only one “layer” of the system's knowledge and achieve correct processing of the extended input by the entire system.

#! This paper is a discussion of the technical issues and solutions encountered in making the ASK System transportable. A natural language system can be “transportable” in a number of ways. Although transportability to a new domain is most prominent, other ways are also important if the system is to have viability in the commercial marketplace.On the one hand, transporting a system to a new domain may start with the system prior to adding any domain of knowledge and extend it to incorporate the new domain. On the other hand, one may wish to add to a system that already has knowledge of one domain the knowledge concerning a second domain, that is, to extend the system to cover this second domain. In the context of ASK, it has been natural to implement extending and then achieve transportability as a special case.In this paper, we consider six ways in which the ASK System can be extended to include new capabilities:to a new domain,to a new object type,to access data from a foreign database,to a new natural language,to a new programming language,to a new computer family.Special-purpose applications, such as those to accommodate standard office tasks, would make use of these various means of extension.

#! The Linguistic String Project (LSP) natural language processing system has been developed as a domain-independent natural language processing system. Initially utilized for processing sets of medical messages and other texts in the medical domain, it has been used at the Naval Research Laboratory for processing Navy messages about shipboard equipment failures. This paper describes the structure of the LSP system and the features that make it transportable from one domain to another. The processing procedures encourage the isolation of domain-specific information, yet take advantage of the syntactic and semantic similarities between the medical and Navy domains. From our experience in transporting the LSP system, we identify the features that are required for transportable natural language systems.

#! PRE (Purposefully Restricted English) is a restricted English database query language whose implementation has addressed engineering goals, namely, habitability, interapplication transportability, performance, and use with a reliable database management system that supports large numbers of concurrent users and large databases. Habitability has not been demonstrated, but initial indications are encouraging. The other goals have clearly been achieved. The existence of the PRE system demonstrates that an explicitly “minimalist” approach to natural language processing can facilitate achievement of transportability.

#! Our goal is to develop formal methods for abstracting a given set of programs into a program schemaand for instantiating a given schema to satisfy concrete specifications. Abstraction and instantiationare two important phases in software development which allow programmers to apply knowledgelearned in the solutions of past problems when faced with new situations. For example, from twoprograms using a linear (or binary) search technique, an abstract schema can be derived that embodiesthe shared idea and that can be instantiated to solve similar new problems. Along similar lines, thedevelopment and application of program transformations are considered.We suggest the formulation of analogies as a basic tool in program abstraction. An analogy is firstsought between the specifications of the given programs; this yields an abstract specification thatmay be instantiated to any of the given concrete specifications. The analogy is then used as a basisfor transforming the existing programs into an abstract schema that represents the embeddedtechnique, with the invariant assertions and correctness proofs of the given programs helping toverify and complete the analogy. A given concrete specification of a new problem may then becompared with the abstract specification of the schema to suggest an instantiation of the schemathat yields a correct program.

Virtual time is a new paradigm for organizing and synchronizing distributed systems which can be applied to such problems as distributed discrete event simulation and distributed database concurrency control. Virtual time provides a flexible abstraction of real time in much the same way that virtual memory provides an abstraction of real memory. It is implemented using the Time Warp mechanism, a synchronization protocol distinguished by its reliance on lookahead-rollback, and by its implementation of rollback via antimessages.

#! This paper introduces data distortion by probability distribution, a probability distortion that involves three steps. The first step is to identify the underlying density function of the original series and to estimate the parameters of this density function. The second step is to generate a series of data from the estimated density function. And the final step is to map and replace the generated series for the original one. Because it is replaced by the distorted data set, probability distortion guards the privacy of an individual belonging to the original data set. At the same time, the probability distorted series provides asymptotically the same statistical properties as those of the original series, since both are under the same distribution. Unlike conventional point distortion, probability distortion is difficult to compromise by repeated queries, and provides a maximum exposure for statistical analysis.

A molecular object is a modeling construct which enables a database entity to be represented by two sets of heterogeneous records, one set describes the object's interface and the other describes its implementation. Thus a reasonable starting point for modeling design objects is to begin with the concept of molecular objects.In this paper, we identify modeling concepts that are fundamental to capturing the semantics of VLSI CAD design objects and versions in terms of molecular objects. A provisional set of user operations on design objects, consistent with these modeling concepts, is also defined. The modeling framework that we present has been found useful for investigating physical storage techniques and change notification problems in version control.

#! A parser must be able to continue parsing after encountering a syntactic error to check the remainder of the input. To achieve this, it is not necessary to perform corrections on either the input text or the stack contents. A formal framework is provided in which noncorrecting syntax error recovery concepts are defined and investigated. The simplicity of these concepts allows the statement of provable properties, such as the absence of spurious error messages or the avoidance of skipping input text. These properties are due to the fact that no assumptions about the nature of the errors need be made to continue parsing.

#! A new simplified methodology for relational-database design overcomes the difficulties associated with nonloss decomposition. It states dependencies between data fields on a dependency list and then depicts them unambiguously as interlinked bubbles and doublebubbles on a dependency diagram. From the dependency diagram, a set of fully normalized tables is derived.

#! In this article we develop some algorithms and tools for solving matrix problems on parallel processing computers. Operations are synchronized through data-flow alone, which makes global synchronization unnecessary and enables the algorithms to be implemented on machines with very simple operating systems and communication protocols. As examples, we present algorithms that form the main modules for solving Liapounov matrix equations. We compare this approach to wave front array processors and systolic arrays, and note its advantages in handling missized problems, in evaluating variations of algorithms or architectures, in moving algorithms from system to system, and in debugging parallel algorithms on sequential machines.

#! Model building is identified as the most important part of the analysis and design process for software systems. A set of primitives to support this process is presented, along with a formal language, MSG.84, for recording the results of analysis and design. The semantics of the notation is defined in terms of the actor formalism, which is based on a message passing paradigm. The automatic derivation of a graphical form of the specification for user review is discussed. Potentials for computer-aided design based on MSG.84 are indicated.

#! Few examples of formal specification of the semantics of user interfaces exist in the literature. This paper presents a comparison of four axiomatic approaches which we have applied to the specification of a commercial user interface-the line editor for the Tandy PC-1 Pocket Computer. These techniques are shown to result in complete and relatively concise descriptions. A number of useful and nontrivial properties of the interface are formally deduced from one of the specifications. In addition, a direct implementation of the interface is constructed from a formal specification. Limitations of these specification examples are discussed along with future research work.

Displays are composed of components and the user can specify geometry of the components and grouping relationships between the components which allow for the generation of the desired display.

An early step in the methodology is the creation of a formal executable description of the user interaction with the system, based on augmented state transition diagrams. This paper shows the derivation of the USE transition diagrams based on perceived shortcomings of the "pure" state transition diagram approach. In this way, the features of the USE specification notation are gradually presented and illustrated. The paper shows both the graphical notation and the textual equivalent of the notation, and briefly describes the automated tools that support direct execution of the specification.

Computer viewscreens are evolving into pictorial media, communicating information with visual immediacy. The more interesting interfaces make use of multiple windows, menus, icons, and other visual effects to waken and sustain user interest and effectiveness. A pretty window is a viewscreen window with the dimensions of a golden rectangle, a rectangle whose width and height form the golden ratio of Euclid. Psychologists believe golden rectangles are aesthetically more pleasing than arbitrary rectangles, and subjects tend to select them in preference to other rectangles in tests.

A unified model, called office procedure model (OPM), is presented to model office procedures. The OPM describes the relationships among messages, databases, alerters, and activities. The OPM can be used to coordinate and integrate the activities of an office procedure. The OPM also allows the specification of office protocols in an office information system. A methodology for the verification of office procedures is presented. With this methodology, potential problems in office procedure specification, such as deadlock, unspecified message reception, etc., can be analyzed effectively.

#@ Ali Mili

#c IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering - Annals of discrete mathematics, 24
#! When the state of a program in execution is accidentally altered, a recovery action may be needed before the execution can proceed on. Two approaches exist for the design of recovery actions: backward recovery consists of retrieving a previously saved correct state and restarting the computation; forward recovery consists of generating á (sufficiently) correct state from the current (not too) contaminated state. This paper presents a tentative framework for the study of forward error recovery and then discusses some preliminary results and some future research within the proposed framework.

The small projects are presented because they provide examples (that will fit into a paper) of certain types of phenomena. Data bindings between the routines of the system provide the basis for the bindings. It appears that the clustering of data bindings provides a meaningful view of system modularization.

#! The notion of a qualified function is introduced as a general means of representing the parameters of dynamic systems. Two specific types of qualified functions are defined for the analysis of the behavior and performance of structured programs. Transformation functions represent the values of variables during execution and timing algorithms express the execution times of programs symbolically. Complete rules of derivation for transformation functions and timing algorithms are given for the control mechanisms of sequence, selection, fixed loop, and while statement. Deterministic and stochastic simplification of transformation functions and timing algorithms are investigated and methods of eliminating recursion for expressions corresponding to while statements are studied.

Finally, it is shown that a structural approach, based on abstract data type specifications, provides a suitable representation for symbolic constants.

#! Mathematical models when simulating the behavior of physical, chemical, and biological systems often include one or more ordinary differential equations (ODEs). To study the system behavior predicted by a model, these equations are usually solved numerically.Although many of the current methods for solving ODEs were developed around the turn of the century, the past 15 years or so has been a period of intensive research. The emphasis of this survey is on the methods and techniques used in software for solving ODEs.ODEs can be classified as stiff or nonstiff, and may be stiff for some parts of an interval and nonstiff for others. We discuss stiff equations, why they are difficult to solve, and methods and software for solving both nonstiff and stiff equations. We conclude this review by looking at techniques for dealing with special problems that may arise in some ODEs, for example, discontinuities.Although important theoretical developments have also taken place, we report only those developments which have directly affected the software and provide a review of this research. We present the basic concepts involved but assume that the reader has some background in numerical computing, such as a first course in numerical methods.

This paper proposes a precise definition of the 3-D object recognition problem, discusses basic concepts associated with this problem, and reviews the relevant literature. Because range images (or depth maps) are often used as sensor input instead of intensity images, techniques for obtaining, processing, and characterizing range data are also surveyed.

#! A major portion of the effort expended in developing commercial software today is associated with program testing. Schedule and/ or resource constraints frequently require that testing be conducted so as to uncover the greatest number of errors possible in the time allowed. In this paper we describe a study undertaken to assess the potential usefulness of various product-and process-related measures in identifying error-prone software. Our goal was to establish an empirical basis for the efficient utilization of limited testing resources using objective, measurable criteria. Through a detailed analysis of three software products and their error discovery histories, we have found simple metrics related to the amount of data and the structural complexity of programs to be of value for this purpose.

#* Performance Evaluation of Centralized Databases with Static Locking
#@ Alexander Thomasian
#t 1985
#c IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering
#! The performance of transaction processing systems is determined by the contention for hardware as well as software resources (database locks), due to the concurrency control mechanism of the database being accessed by transactions. We consider a transaction processing system with a set of dominant transcation classes. Each class needs to acquire a certain subset of the locks in the database before it can be processed, i.e., predeclared lock requests with static locking. Straightforward application of the decomposition method requires the numerical solution of a two-dimensional Markov chain. Equivalently, a hierarchical simulation method, where the computer system is represented by a composite queue with exponential service rates, can be used to analyze the system. We propose an inexpensive analytic solution method, also based on hierarchical decomposition, such that the throughput of the computer system ic characterized by the number of active transactions (regardless of class). Numerical results are provided to show that the new method is adequately accurate compared to the other two rather costly methods. It can be used to determine the effect of granularity of locking on system performance. The solution method is also applicable to multiresource queueing systems with multiple contention points.

#! This paper defines a family of program test data selection criteria derived from data flow analysis techniques similar to those used in compiler optimization. It is argued that currently used path selection criteria, which examine only the control flow of a program, are inadequate quate. Our procedure associates with each point in a program at which a variable is defined, those points at which the value is used. Several test data selection criteria, differing in the type and number of these associations, are defined and compared.

#* An Approach to the Modeling of Software Testing with Some Applications
#@ Thomas Downs
#t 1985
#c IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering
#! In this paper, an approach to the modeling of software testing is described. A major aim of this approach is to allow the assessment of the effects of different testing (and debugging) strategies in different situations. It is shown how the techniques developed can be used to estimate, prior to the commencement of testing, the optimum allocation of test effort for software which is to be nonuniformly executed in its operational phase. In addition, the question of application of statistical models in cases where the data environment undergoes changes is discussed. Finally, two models are presented for the assessment of the effects of imperfections in the debugging process.

#* Flex: A High-Level Language for Specifying Customized Microprocessors
#@ Douglas E. Comer;Narain H. Gehani
#t 1985
#c IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering
#! Researchers at Bell Labs have recently developed a silicon compiler, named Plex, that automatically generates VLSI layouts of high performance and area efficient microprocessors. Plex takes as input a specification of the function to be executed and generates a complete mask-level layout of a customized microprocessor to execute that function. The Plex microprocessor interacts with the external world, via input and output wires, and interrupts. The dedicated function performed by a Plex microprocessor typically involves real-time handling of inputs and interrupts-and the real-time generation of output signals.

#* Communication and Synchronization Primitives for Distributed Programs
#@ N. Natarajan
#t 1985
#c IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering
#! A distributed program is a collection of several processes which execute concurrently, possibly in different nodes of a distributed system, and which cooperate with each other to realize a common goal. In this paper, we present a design of communication and synchronization primitives for distributed programs. The primitives are designed such that they can be provided by a kernel of a distributed operating system. An important feature of the design is that the configuration of a process, i.e., identities of processes with which the process communicates, is specified separately from the computation performed by the process. This permits easy configuration and reconfiguration of processes. We identify different kinds of communication failures, and provide distinct mechanisms for handling them. The communication primitives are not atomic actions. To enable the construction of atomic actions, two new program components, atomic agent and manager are introduced. These are devoid of policy decisions regarding concurrency control and atomic commitment. We introduce the notion of conflicts relation using which a designer can construct either an optimistic or a pessimistic concurrency control scheme. The design also incorporates primitives for constructing nested atomic actions.

#* Discrete Time Stochastic Petri Nets
#@ Michael K. Molloy
#t 1985
#c IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering
#! Basic graph models of processes, such as Petri nets, have usually omitted the concept of time as a parameter. Time has been added to the Petri net model in two ways. The timed Petri net (TPN) uses a fixed number of discrete time intervals. The stochastic Petri net (SPN) uses an exponentially distributed random variable. In this paper, a discrete time stochastic Petri model is described. These discrete time SPN's fill the gap between TPN and normal SPN. However, the use of discrete time complicates the SPN model in that more than one transition may fire at a time step. Finally, an example of a live and bounded Petri net which has nonempty, disjoint, recurrent subsets of markings is given.

#* Dynamic Configuration for Distributed Systems
#@ Jeff Kramer;Jeff Magee
#t 1985
#c IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering
#! Dynamic system configuration is the ability to modify and extend a system while it is running. The facility is a requirement in large distributed systems where it may not be possible or economic to stop the entire system to allow modification to part of its hardware or software. It is also useful during production of the system to aid incremental integration of component parts, and during operation to aid system evolution. The paper introduces a model of the configuration process which permits dynamic incremental modification and extension. Using this model we determine the properties required by languages and their execution environments to support dynamic configuration. CONIC, the distributed system which has been developed at Imperial College with the specific objective of supporting dynamic configuration, is described to illustrate the feasibility of the model.

#@ Abdol-Hossein Esfahanian;S. L. Hakimi
#t 1985
#c IEEE Transactions on Computers
#! A class of communication networks which is suitable for "multiple processor systems" was studied by Pradhan and Reddy. The underlying graph (to be called Shift and Replace graph or SRG) is based on DeBruijn digraphs and is a function of two parameters r and m. Pradhan and Reddy have shown that the node-connectivity of SRG is at least r. The same authors give a routing algorithm which generally requires 2m hops if the number of node failures is =(r -1). In this paper we show that the node-connectivity of SRG is (2r - 2). This would immediately imply that the system can tolerate up to (2r - 3) node failures. We then present routing methods for situations with a certain number of node failures. When this number is =(r - 2) our routing algorithm requires at most m + 3 + logr m hops if 3 + logr m =m. When the number of node failures is =(2r - 3) our routing algorithm requires at most m + 5 + logr m hops if 4 + logr m = m. In all the other situations our routing algorithm requires no more than 2m hops. The routing algorithms are shown to be computationally efficient.

#* High-Speed VLSI Multiplication Algorithm with a Redundant Binary Addition Tree
#@ Naofumi Takagi;Hiroto Yasuura;Shuzo Yajima
#t 1985
#c IEEE Transactions on Computers
#! A high-speed VLSI multiplication algorithm internally using redundant binary representation is proposed. In n bit binary integer multiplication, n partial products are first generated and then added up pairwise by means of a binary tree of redundant binary adders. Since parallel addition of two n-digit redundant binary numbers can be performed in a constant time independent of n without carry propagation, n bit multiplication can be performed in a time proportional to log2 n. The computation time is almost the same as that by a multiplier with a Wallace tree, in which three partial products will be converted into two, in contrast to our two-to-one conversion, and is much shorter than that by an array multiplier for longer operands. The number of computation elements of an n bit multiplier based on the algorithm is proportional to n2. It is almost the same as those of conventional ones. Furthermore, since the multiplier has a regular cellular array structure similar to an array multiplier, it is suitable for VLSI implementation. Thus, the multiplier is excellent in both computation speed and regularity in layout. It can be implemented on a VLSI chip with an area proportional to n2 log2 n. The algorithm can be directly applied to both unsigned and 2's complement binary integer multiplication.

#* Concurrent Fault Detection in Microprogrammed Control Units
#@ Vijay S. Iyengar;L. L. Kinney
#t 1985
#c IEEE Transactions on Computers
#! This paper specifies procedures for defining a monitor circuit that can detect faults in microprogram sequencers. The monitor and the sequencer operate in parallel and errors are detected by comparing outputs from the monitor circuit with outputs from the sequencer. Faults that cause errors in the flow of control are detectable, as well as some faults that cause errors only in the microinstruction fields. The design procedure presented for monitors consists of four parts. First, a model of the program flow is constructed that only retains the information required to define a monitor. Second, faults in a specified fault set are modeled by the errors they cause in the program flow model. Third, the functional requirements of the monitor are specified in terms of partitions on the states of the program flow model. Fourth, the logic design of the monitor is completed.

On the problems the Orrery was designed to solve, it achieves approximately 10 Mflops in about 1 ft3 of space while consuming 150 W of power. The specialized parallel architecture of the Orrery, which is well matched to orbital mechanics problems, is the key to obtaining such high performance. In this paper we discuss the design, construction, and programming of the Orrery.

#* Efficient Storage Management for Temporary Values in Concurrent Programming Languages
#@ Donna Quammen;John P. Kearns;Mary L. Soffa
#t 1985
#c IEEE Transactions on Computers
#! An evaluation stack, used exclusively to store temporary values in expression evaluation, is known to be an effective mechanism in the implementation of high level languages. This work considers the efficient management of evaluation stacks for concurrent programming languages. Techniques for sharing a single evaluation stack among many processes, without copying on process switches, are developed. The best strategy for managing the evaluation stack is shown to depend strongly upon the scheduling paradigm adopted by the run-time support of the language. Simulation studies, driven by synthetic workloads, show that the techniques described in this paper exhibit substantial performance improvements over traditional temporary storage management schemes for concurrent languages.

#* An Efficient Unsorted VLSI Dictionary Machine
#@ Arun K. Somani;Vinod K. Agarwal
#t 1985
#c IEEE Transactions on Computers
#! A systolic binary tree machine which can handle all the dictionary machine and priority queue operations such as Insert, Delete, Extract-Min, Extract-Max, Member, and Near is designed in this paper. The operations can be fed into the tree machine in a pipeline manner at a constant rate and the output is correspondingly generated in a pipeline manner. Each processor in the machine stores at most one data element, which consists of a key value and a record associated with the key. The machine has optimal performance since if the number of data elements present in the tree is n, then each operation takes O(log n) steps. Unlike some recent designs, this machine does not use any links other than the binary tree links, provides optimal performance without the need to store data elements in any sorted order by exploiting dynamic rebalancing, has higher throughput, and keeps the logical last level of the tree on one physical level of the tree.

#* A simplex algorithm whose average number of steps is bounded between two quadratic functions of the smaller dimension

#! It has been a challenge for mathematicians to confirm theoretically the extremely good performance of simplex-type algorithms for linear programming. In this paper the average number of steps performed by a simplex algorithm, the so-called self-dual method, is analyzed. The algorithm is not started at the traditional point (1, … , l)T, but points of the form (1, &egr;, &egr;2, …)T, with &egr; sufficiently small, are used. The result is better, in two respects, than those of the previous analyses. First, it is shown that the expected number of steps is bounded between two quadratic functions c1(min(m, n))2 and c2(min(m, n))2 of the smaller dimension of the problem. This should be compared with the previous two major results in the field. Borgwardt proves an upper bound of O(n4m1/(n-1)) under a model that implies that the zero vector satisfies all the constraints, and also the algorithm under his consideration solves only problems from that particular subclass. Smale analyzes the self-dual algorithm starting at (1, … , 1)T. He shows that for any fixed m there is a constant c(m) such the expected number of steps is less than c(m)(ln n)m(m+1); Megiddo has shown that, under Smale's model, an upper bound C(m) exists. Thus, for the first time, a polynomial upper bound with no restrictions (except for nondegeneracy) on the problem is proved, and, for the first time, a nontrivial lower bound of precisely the same order of magnitude is established. Both Borgwardt and Smale require the input vectors to be drawn from spherically symmetric distributions. In the model in this paper, invariance is required only under certain

#! In a distributed system, one strategy for achieving mutual exclusion of groups of nodes without communication is to assign to each node a number of votes. Only a group with a majority of votes can execute the critical operations, and mutual exclusion is achieved because at any given time there is at most one such group. A second strategy, which appears to be similar to votes, is to define a priori a set of groups that intersect each other. Any group of nodes that finds itself in this set can perform the restricted operations. In this paper, both of these strategies are studied in detail and it is shown that they are not equivalent in general (although they are in some cases). In doing so, a number of other interesting properties are proved. These properties will be of use to a system designer who is selecting a vote assignment or a set of groups for a specific application.

#! Backtrack search is often used to solve constraint satisfaction problems. A relationship involving the structure of the constraints is described that provides a bound on the backtracking required to advance deeper into the backtrack tree. This analysis leads to upper bounds on the effort required for solution of a class of constraint satisfaction problems. The solutions involve a combination of relaxation preprocessing and backtrack search. The bounds are expressed in terms of the structure of the constraint connections. Specifically, the effort is shown to have a bound exponential in the size of the largest biconnected component of the constraint graph, as opposed to the size of the graph as a whole.

#! A parallel algorithm is presented that accepts as input a graph G and produces a maximal independent set of vertices in G. On a P-RAM without the concurrent write or concurrent read features, the algorithm executes in O((log n)4) time and uses O((n/(log n))3) processors, where n is the number of vertices in G. The algorithm has several novel features that may find other applications. These include the use of balanced incomplete block designs to replace random sampling by deterministic sampling, and the use of a “dynamic pigeonhole principle” that generalizes the conventional pigeonhole principle.

#! The problem of simulating a synchronous network by an asynchronous network is investigated. A new simulation technique, referred to as a synchronizer, which is a new, simple methodology for designing efficient distributed algorithms in asynchronous networks, is proposed. The synchronizer exhibits a trade-off between its communication and time complexities, which is proved to be within a constant factor of the lower bound.

#! Previous research in modeling office activities has been primarily oriented toward office work that is structured and organized. In this paper we report on efforts to develop a new methodology for needs assessment evaluation. We use the Critical Task Method to identify the “bottleneck cognitive tasks” of principals with an unstructured work profile. Data were collected on the computer-support needs of faculty researchers, and the findings indicate that a “knowledge-based” design offers the most promise for delivering effective support. In addition, the systems design suggests the integration of text, data, voice, and images.

#! Recently, office communication systems have begun to integrate voice recordings into their mail and data communications facilities. The study of usage patterns on one such system shows that voice is used for informal, person-to-person communications, as opposed to the formal content of typed messages. Voice messages are generally sent to fewer recipients (often only one), and sometimes replace face-to-face meetings.

#! A prototype system has been implemented for electronic scanning, digitization, storage, retrieval, and display of images of biomedical documents. Paper documents are scanned and digitized at a scan density of 200 picture elements (pels) per inch by either a high-speed loose-leaf scanner with an automatic document transport or a book scanner with a manual book holder. Each scanner employs a high-resolution charge-coupled device (CCD) linear array operating at a sampling rate close to 10 MHz. The analog output signal of the CCD array is digitized into 1 bit per pixel two-tone images by means of dynamic thresholding. The digitized images are stored on magnetic disks to be processed and will eventually be transferred onto optical disks for archival storage. Existing on-line bibliographic databases developed by the National Library of Medicine are used as directories for the retrieval of document images. These images are displayed at a resolution of 200 pels/inch in both soft-copy (raster-refreshed CRT) and hard-copy forms.This prototype system, developed as part of a research and development program, offers the opportunity to investigate the areas of document image enhancement, image compression, and omnifont text recognition and to conduct experiments designed to answer key questions on the role of electronic document storage and retrieval technology in library information processing and the preservation of library documents.

#! An approach to the coordinated sharing and interchange of computerized information is described emphasizing partial, controlled sharing among autonomous databases. Office information systems provide a particularly appropriate context for this type of information sharing and exchange. A federated database architecture is described in which a collection of independent database systems are united into a loosely coupled federation in order to share and exchange information. A federation consists of components (of which there may be any number) and a single federal dictionary. The components represent individual users, applications, workstations, or other components in an office information system. The federal dictionary is a specialized component that maintains the topology of the federation and oversees the entry of new components. Each component in the federation controls its interactions with other components by means of an export schema and an import schema. The export schema specifies the information that a component will share with other components, while the import schema specifies the nonlocal information that a component wishes to manipulate. The federated architecture provides mechanisms for sharing data, for sharing transactions (via message types) for combining information from several components, and for coordinating activities among autonomous components (via negotiation). A prototype implementation of the federated database mechanism is currently operational on an experimental basis.

#! A simple model, AT, for nondeterministic machines is presented which is based on certain types of trees. A set of operations, &Sgr;, is defined over AT and it is shown to be completely characterized by a set of inequations over &Sgr;. AT is used to define the denotational semantics of a language for defining nondeterministic machines. The significance of the model is demonstrated by showing that this semantics reflects an intuitive operational semantics of machines based on the idea that machines should only be differentiated if there is some experiment that differentiates between them.

#! The problem of recognizing the language Ln(Ln, k) of solvable Diophantine linear equations with n variables (and solutions from {O, … , k}n) is considered. The languages ∪n&egr;N Ln, ∪n&egr;N Ln, l, the knapsack problem, are NP-complete. The &OHgr;(n2 lower bound for Ln,1 on linear search algorithms due to Dobkin and Lipton is generalized to an &OHgr;(n2log(k + 1)) lower bound for Ln, k. The method of Klein and Meyer auf der Heide is further improved to carry over the &OHgr;(n2) lower bound for Ln, 1 to random access machines (RAMS) in such a way that it holds for a large class of problems and for very small input sets. By this method, lower bounds that depend on the input size, as is necessary for Ln, are proved. Thereby, an &OHgr;(n2log(k + 1)) lower bound is obtained for RAMS recognizing Ln or Ln, k, for inputs from {0, … , (nk)0(n2)}n.

#! Combinatorial techniques for extending lower bound results for decision trees to general types of queries are presented. Problems that are defined by simple inequalities between inputs, called order invariant problems, are considered. A decision tree is called k-bounded if each query depends on at most k variables. No further assumptions on the type of queries are made. It is proved that one can replace the queries of any k-bounded decision tree that solves an order-invariant problem over a large enough input domain with k-bounded queries whose outcome depends only on the relative order of the inputs. As a consequence, all existing lower bounds for comparison-based algorithms are valid for general k-bounded decision trees, where k is a constant.An &OHgr;(n log n) lower bound for the element uniqueness problem and several other problems for any k-bounded decision tree, such that k = O(nc) and c n1/2-bounded decision trees of complexity O(n) that solve the element-uniqueness problem. All the lower bounds mentioned above are shown to hold for nondeterministic and probabilistic decision trees as well.

In this paper, design stability measures which indicate the potential ripple effect characteristics due to modifications of the program at the design level are presented. These measures can be generated at any point in the design phase of the software life cycle which enables early maintainability feedback to the software developers. The validation of these measures and future research efforts involving the development of a user-oriented maintainability measure, which incorporates the design stability measures as well as other design measures, are discussed.

Further, the specification itself can be incorrect or incomplete due to the complex requirements.

#* Database Integrity Block Construct: Concepts and Design Issues
#@ Leszek Lilien;Bharat Bhargava
#t 1985
#c IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering - Special issue on COMPSAC 1982 and 1983
#! When a crash occurs in a transaction processing system, the database can enter an unacceptable state. To continue the processing, the recovery system has three tasks: 1) verification of the database state for acceptability, 2) restoration of an acceptable database state, and 3) restoration of an acceptable history of transaction processing. Unfortunately these tasks are not trivial and the computational complexity of the algorithms for most of them is either NP-complete or NP-hard. In this paper we discuss the concepts and design issues of a construct called database integrity block (DIB). The implementation of this construct allows for efficient verification of the database state by employing a set of integrity assertions and restoration of transaction history by utilizing any database restoration technique such as audit trail or differential file. This paper presents approximation algorithms for minimizing the costs of evaluation of integrity assertions by modeling the problem as the directed traveling salesman problem, and presents a methodology to compare the costs of audit trail and differential file techniques for database restoration. The applicability of integrity verification research to the problem of multiple-query optimization is also included.

#@ Benjamin W. Wah;Chee F. Yu
#t 1985
#c IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering - Special issue on COMPSAC 1982 and 1983
#! Branch-and-bound algorithms are organized and intelligently structured searches of solutions in a combinatorially large problem space. In this paper, we propose an approximate stochastic model of branch-and-bound algorithms with a best-first search. We have estimated the average memory space required and have predicted the average number of subproblems expanded before the process terminates. Both measures are exponentials of sublinear exponent. In addition, we have also compared the number of subproblems expanded in a best-first search to that expanded in a depth-first search. Depth-first search has been found to have computational complexity comparable to best-first search when the lower-bound function is very accurate or very inaccurate; otherwise, best-fit search is usually better. The results obtained are useful in studying the efficient evaluation of branch-and-bound algorithms in a virtual memory environment. They also confirm that approximations are very effective in reducing the total number of iterations.

#! The problems of developing software requirements and quality assurance techniques have basically dealt with an environment where a single organization acts as the designer, developer, and user of the software product. Since the mid-1970' s, however, there has been a great increase in the use of "packaged" software products designed and developed by one organization for use in a variety of other organizations. The great profusion of products has resulted in many products being peddled for generic applications (accounting, manufacturing, etc.) which are of questionable quality and/or "fit" to a given organization's environment. This paper describes some techniques that are being used to certify software produced by third parties and how to determine if the "fit" is there. Current quality assurance techniques deal with the "correctness" of a program as compared to its specifications [2], [4], [7], [8], [12]. The real issue for a purchaser of software is whether the software is "correct" for its environment.

#! A research prototype software system for conceptual information retrieval has been developed. The goal of the system, called RUBRIC, is to provide more automated and relevant access to unformatted textual databases. The approach is to use production rules from artificial intelligence to define a hierarchy of retrieval subtopics, with fuzzy context expressions and specific word phrases at the bottom. RUBRIC allows the definition of detailed queries starting at a conceptual level, partial matching of a query and a document, selection of only the highest ranked documents for presentation to the user, and detailed explanation of how and why a particular document was selected. Initial experiments indicate that a RUBRIC rule set better matches human retrieval judgment than a standard Boolean keyword expression, given equal amounts of effort in defining each. The techniques presented may be useful in stand-alone retrieval systems, front-ends to existing information retrieval systems, or real-time document filtering and routing.

The intent of the project is to identify project independent measures which may be used in a management tool for monitoring software development. This study examines several Fortran projects with similar profiles. The staff was experienced in developing these types of projects. The projects developed serve similar functions. Because these projects are similar we believe some underlying relationships exist that are invariant between the projects. These relationships, once well defined, may be used to compare the development of different projects to determine whether they are evolving the same way previous projects in this environment evolved.

In order to program SIMD (single instruction stream-multiple data stream) parallel machines used for tasks such as speech and image processing, a language with explicit parallel constructs is often desirable. The language Ada, developed by the Department of Defense, is used here as a basis for such a language. Extensions of Ada, which allow the user to specify such operations as interprocessor communications and activation of processors, are proposed. These features are demonstrated by showing their use in a common speech processing algorithm, the parallel FFT.

#! A number of data structures for representing images by quadtrees without pointers are discussed. The image is treated as a collection of leaf nodes. Each leaf node is represented by use of a locational code corresponding to a sequence of directional codes that locate the leaf along a path from the root of the tree. Somewhat related is the concept of a forest which is a representation that consists of a collection of maximal blocks. It is reviewed and refined to enable the representation of a quadtree as a sequence of approximations. In essence, all BLACK and WHITE nodes are said to be of type GB and GW, respectively. GRAY nodes are of type GB if at least two of their sons are of type GB; otherwise, they are of type GW. Sequences of approximations using various combinations of locational codes of GB and GW nodes are proposed and shown to be superior to approximation methods based on truncation of nodes below a certain level in the tree. These approximations have two important properties. First, they are progressive in the sense that as more of the image is transmitted, the receiving device can construct a better approximation (contrast with facsimile methods which transmit the image one line at a time). Second, they are proved to lead to compression in the sense that they never require more than MIN(B, W) nodes where B and W correspond to the number of BLACK and WHITE nodes in the original quadtree. Algorithms are given for constructing the approximation sequences as well as decoding them to rebuild the original quadtree.

#! We describe an expert system for resource allocation in a particular military domain. The system incorporates variants of several important techniques of artificial intelligence and makes the first use of the Merit system for question selection. This technique enables the system to direct the acquisition of information by finding questions with a high ratio of probable importance to difficulty. In the current application, each resource is a military weapon, each task to which such a resource can be allocated is firing at a military target, and the objective function is the expected reduction in value of targets. The coefficients that relate a particular resource to a particular task are not provided explicitly. Instead, in the first phase of the allocation process, the system uses a computation network to determine the effectiveness of each individual weapon against each prospective target. The network, built by a domain expert in advance, allows reasoning with logical, Bayesian, and expert-defined operators. After the calculation of individual effectiveness values, portions of an allocation tree are constructed to determine good allocation plans for the set of weapons. The individual effectiveness values are used to direct the traversal and pruning of the allocation tree.

#@ Michel Bidoit;Brigitte Biebow;Marie-Claude Gaudel;Christian Gresse;Gérard D. Guiho
#t 1985
#c IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering
#! We present an algebraic specification language (PLUSS) and a program construction method. Programs are built systematically from an algebraic specification of the data they deal with. The method was tested on a realistic problem (part of a telephone switching system). In these experiments, it turned out that error handling was the difficult part to specify and to program. This paper shows how to cope with this problem at the specification level and during the program development process.

#! The discipline of software engineering can be extended in a natural way to deal with the issues raised by a systematic approach to the design of human-machine interfaces. Two main points are made: that the user should be treated as part of the system being designed, and that projects should be organized to take account of the current (small) state of a priori knowledge about how to design interfaces.

#* PROUST: Knowledge-Based Program Understanding
#@ W. L. Johnson;Elliot Soloway
#t 1985
#c IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering
#! This paper describes a program called PROUST which does on-line analysis and understanding of Pascal written by novice programmers. PROUST takes as input a program and a nonalgorithmic description of the program requirements, and finds the most likely mapping between the requirements and the code. This mapping is in essence a reconstruction of the design and implementation steps that the programmer went through in writing the program. A knowledge base of programming plans and strategies, together with common bugs associated with them, is used in constructing this mapping. Bugs are discovered in the process of relating plans to the code; PROUST can therefore give deep explanations of program bugs by relating the buggy code to its underlying intentions.

#! This paper describes the PECAN family of program development systems. PECAN supports multiple views of the user's program. The views can be representations of the program or of the corresponding semantics. The primary program view is a syntax-directed editor. The current semantic views include expression trees, data type diagrams, flow graphs, and the symbol table. PECAN is designed to make effective use of powerful personal machines with high-resolution graphics displays and is currently implemented on APOLLO workstations.

#* A Tour Through Cedar
#@ Warren Teitelman
#t 1985
#c IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering
#! This paperlintroduces the reader to many of the salient features of the Cedar programming environment, a state-of-the-art progrmming system that combines in a single integrated environment: high quality graphics, a sophisticated editor and document preparation facility, and a variety of tools for the programmer to use in the construction and debugging of his programs. The Cedar programming language [8] is a strongly typed, compiler-oriented language of the Pascal family. What is especially interesting about the Cedar project is that it is one of the few examples where an interactive, experimental programming environment has been built for this kind of language. In the past, such environments have been confined to dynamically typed languages like Lisp and Smalltalk.

#* Steps to an Advanced Ada1Programming Environment
#@ Richard N. Taylor;Thomas A. Standish
#t 1985
#c IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering
#! Conceptual simplicity, tight coupling of tools, and effective support of host-target software development will characterize advanced Ada programming support environments. Several important principles have been demonstrated in the Arcturus system, including template-assisted Ada editing, command completion using Ada as a command language, and combining the advantages of interpretation and compilation. Other principles, relating to analysis, testing, and debugging of concurrent Ada programs, have appeared in other contexts. This paper discusses several of these topics, considers how they can be integrated, and argues for their inclusion in an environment appropriate for software development in the late 1980's.

#! For hash tables in which a strict physical separation exists between primary storage and storage for overflow records, with bucket capacity at least three, a complete probability model is described. A measure of hash table efficiency is introduced, called the table sufficiency index (TSI), and defined as the probability that the overflow space is sufficient assuming that the set of hashed keys has a uniform distribution. The constructed probability model may be used to compute the TSI for hash tables with parameters chosen from a restricted domain. The TSI is advocated as a tool for making decisions about the parameters of small hash tables.

#! A heuristic algorithm is proposed for dynamic calculation of the median and other quantiles. The estimates are produced dynamically as the observations are generated. The observations are not stored; therefore, the algorithm has a very small and fixed storage requirement regardless of the number of observations. This makes it ideal for implementing in a quantile chip that can be used in industrial controllers and recorders. The algorithm is further extended to histogram plotting. The accuracy of the algorithm is analyzed.

#! Although the boundaries of artificial intelligence (AI) remain elusive, computers can now perform musical tasks that were formerly associated exclusively with naturally intelligent musicians. After a historical note, this paper sermonizes on the need for AI techniques in four areas of musical research: composition, performance, music theory, and digital sound processing. The next part surveys recent work involving AI and music. The discussion concentrates on applications in the four areas of research just mentioned. The final part examines how AI techniques of planning and learning could be used to expand the knowledge base and enrich the behavior of musically intelligent systems.

The paper begins with a presentation of the basic concepts involved in the musical interaction with computer devices, followed by a detailed discussion of three musical tasks: music manuscript preparation, music language interfaces for composition, and real-time performance interaction. Fundamental design principles are exposed through an examination of several early computer music systems, especially the Structured Sound Synthesis Project. A survey of numerous systems, based on the following categories, is presented: compositions and synthesis languages, graphics score editing, performance instruments, digital audio processing tools, and computer-aided instruction in music systems. An extensive reference list is provided for further study in the field.

#! We present a different style of axiomatic definition for programming languages. It is oriented toward imperative languages, such as Algol 68, that do not distinguish between statements and expressions. Rather than basing the logic on a notion of pre- or postcondition, we use the value of a programming language expression as the underlying primitive.A number of language constructs are examined in this framework. We argue that this style of definition gives us a significantly different view of the notion of “easy axiomatixability.” Side effects in expressions as well as aliasing between variables are shown to be “easily axiomatizable” in our system.

We present several situations in which a symmetric select leads to a more natural programming style. We show that several semantic principles are violated by a nonsymmetric select, while being satisfied by a symmetric one. In particular, the suggested symmetric intertask communication mechanism is fully abstract and composable, and has a distributed termination rule which reduces the risk of deadlock. Our discussion is in terms of Ada™.

#! An editing by example system is an automatic program synthesis facility embedded in a text editor that can be used to solve repetitive text editing problems. The user provides the editor with a few examples of a text transformation. The system analyzes the examples and generalizes them into a program that can perform the transformation to the rest of the user's text. This paper presents an overview of the design, analysis, and implementation of a practical editing by example system. It studies the problem of synthesizing a text processing program that generalizes the transformation implicitly described by a small number of input/output examples. A class of text processing programs called gap programs is defined and the problems associated with synthesizing them from examples are examined, leading to an efficient heuristic that provably synthesizes a gap program from examples of its input/output behavior. The editing by example system derived from this analysis has been embedded in a production text editor. By developing an editing by example system that solves a useful class of text processing problems, this work demonstrates that program synthesis is feasible in the domain of text editing.

Furthermore, the ideas may be used in system construction and version control, as demonstrated here.

#! Multilisp is a version of the Lisp dialect Scheme extended with constructs for parallel execution. Like Scheme, Multilisp is oriented toward symbolic computation. Unlike some parallel programming languages, Multilisp incorporates constructs for causing side effects and for explicitly introducing parallelism. The potential complexity of dealing with side effects in a parallel context is mitigated by the nature of the parallelism constructs and by support for abstract data types: a recommended Multilisp programming style is presented which, if followed, should lead to highly parallel, easily understandable programs.Multilisp is being implemented on the 32-processor Concert multiprocessor; however, it is ultimately intended for use on larger multiprocessors. The current implementation, called Concert Multilisp, is complete enough to run the Multilisp compiler itself and has been run on Concert prototypes including up to eight processors. Concert Multilisp uses novel techniques for task scheduling and garbage collection. The task scheduler helps control excessive resource utilization by means of an unfair scheduling policy; the garbage collector uses a multiprocessor algorithm based on the incremental garbage collector of Baker.

#! The development of formal, descriptive, and procedural notations has become a practical concern within the field of music now that computers are being applied to musical tasks. Music combines the real-time demands of performance with the intellectual demands of highly developed symbolic systems that are quite different from natural language. The richness and variety of these demands makes the programming language paradigm a natural one in the musical application of computers. This paradigm provides musicians with a fresh perspective on their work. At the same time, music is a very advanced form of human endeavor, making computer music applications a worthy challenge for computer scientists. In this paper we outline the traditional tasks and forms of representation in music, then proceed with a survey of languages that deal with music programming.

#! Affix grammars are used to describe the instruction set of a target architecture for purposes of compiler code generation. A code generator is obtained automatically for a compiler using attributed parsing techniques. A compiler built on this model can automatically perform most popular machine-dependent optimizations, including peephole optimizations. Code generators based on this model demonstrate retargetability for the VAX1-11, iAPX2-86, Z-80003, PDP4-11, MC-68000, NS32032, FOM, and IBM-370 architectures.

#! Previous attempts to apply Halstead's software metrics to APL have led to inconsistent and counter-intuitive results. This work is a further investigation into the application of software metrics to APL to try to resolve some of the inconsistency. The effect of variations in the counting rules on values calculated for the software metrics was studied. These rules were used to analyze a set of programs from a previous study. In addition, a large number of APL programs from a university environment were analyzed. Evidence is presented that verifies that APL has a higher language level than any other common programming language previously studied. Counting monadic and dyadic uses of the same APL symbol as an instance of a different operator was found to have a significant effect on the language level calculated for APL. However, decomposing derived APL functions into separate operators did not seem to have a significant effect on language level.

#* Allocating Independent Subtasks on Parallel Processors
#@ Clyde P. Kruskal;Alan Weiss
#t 1985
#c IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering
#! When using MIMD (multiple instruction, multiple data) parallel computers, one is often confronted with solving a task composed of many independent subtasks where it is necessary to synchronize the processors after all the subtasks have been completed. This paper studies how the subtasks should be allocated to the processors in order to minimize the expected time it takes to finish all the subtasks (sometimes called the makespan). We assume that the running times of the subtasks are independent, identically distributed, increasing failure rate random variables, and that assigning one or more subtasks to a processor entails some overhead, or communication time, that is independent of the number of subtasks allocated. Our analyses, which use ideas from renewal theory, reliability theory, order statistics, and the theory of large deviations, are valid for a wide class of distributions. We show that allocating an equal number of subtasks to each processor all at once has good efficiency. This appears as a consequence of a rather general theorem which shows how some consequences of the central limit theorem hold even when we cannot prove that the central limit theorem applies.

#! Data abstraction is an effective tool in the design of complex systems, and the representation independence it provides is a key factor in the maintenance and adaptation of software systems. This paper describes a system development methodology based on the development of hierarchies of abstract data types (ADT's). The methodology preserves a high degree of representation independence throughout both the design and implementation of complex systems. The methodology is illustrated with examples from the design and implementation of a Vision Research Programming System. These examples include ADT specifications, ADT interface specifications, and partial implementation code for the system in two different programming languages, Ada1 and Fortran.

The efficiency of data compression methods has a signficant impact on the overall performance of these systems.

The emphasis is on the basic idea, motivation, and tradeoffs of each approach. Both software and hardware methods are covered. The paper is concluded by a discussion of several points of research that seem worthy of further investigation.

Data management issues associated with computational statistical operations have been ignored. As a first step towards integrating database management support of statistical operations, we have analyzed the performance of X'X, the QR decomposition, and the Singular Value Factorization. Alternative implementation strategies with respect to the relational and transposed storage organizations are developed. Implementation strategies corresponding to vector building block, vector-matrix, and direct algorithms with explicit buffer management are compared in terms of efficiency in performance.

#! We survey a new way to get quick estimates of the values of simple statistks (like count, mean, standard deviation, maximum, median, and mode frequency) on a large data set. This approach is a comprehensive attempt (apparently the first) to estimate statistics without any sampling. Our "antisampling" techniques have analogies to those of sampling, and exhibit similar estimation accuracy, but can be done much faster than sampling with large computer databases. Antisampling exploits computer science ideas from database theory and expert systems, building an auxiliary structure called a "database abstract." We make detailed comparisons to several different kinds of sampling.

#* An Optimal Algorithm for Processing Distributed Star Queries
#@ Arbee L. P. Chen;Victor O. K. Li
#t 1985
#c IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering
#! The problem of optimal query processing in distributed database systems was shown to be NP-hard. However, for a special type of queries called star queries, we have developed a polynomial optimal algorithm. Semijoin tactics are applied for query processing. An execution graph is introduced to represent the semijoin programs associated with the distributed processing of the queries. We then identify optimality properties of semijoin programs for star queries, and use these properties to derive the optimal semijoin program. We have shown that the optimal semijoin program can be found from serial semijoin strategies, defined as serial semijoin programs which include each semijoin associated with the query exactly once. By making certain assumptions on the file sizes and the semijoin selectivities, we can obtain the optimal semijoin program from these strategies in polynomial time. Our assumption on selectivites is consistent in the sense that we consider the selectivity of a semijoin based on the current database state, i.e., we take into consideration the reduction effects of all prior semijoins.

#* Concurrent Broadcast for Information Dissemination
#@ Donald M. Topkis
#t 1985
#c IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering
#! Concurrent broadcast involves the dissemination of a database, consisting of messages initially distributed among the nodes of a network, so that a copy of the entire database eventually resides at each node. One application is the dissemination of network status information for adaptive routing in a communications network. This paper examines the time complexity and communication complexity of several distributed procedures for concurrent broadcast. The procedures do not use information depending on the network topology. The worst-case time complexity of a flooding procedure for concurrent broadcast is shown to be linear in the number of nodes plus the number of messages, and no other procedure for concurrent broadcast has a better worst-case time complexity. A variant of flooding is proposed to eliminate redundant message receipts from the flooding process by real-time signaling between neighbors concerning messages residing at each. This variant can reduce communication complexity, while having a worst-case time complexity similar in form to that of the flooding procedure. Special properties of concurrent broadcast in a tree are also given. The present time complexity results can be used to bound the time during which inconsistent databases may reside at different nodes, to evaluate and compare procedures for (or including) concurrent broadcast, and to schedule a sequence of instances of concurrent broadcast so that the instances do not overlap and there is no need for sequence numbers.

#* Modeling of Software Partition for Distributed Real-Time Applications
#@ James P. Huang
#t 1985
#c IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering
#! The issue of software partition deals with the process of mapping the given set of logical modules, which reflect the user's point of view, into a set of software tasks, which reflect the software implementor's point of view. It is shown in this paper that the software partitioning problem can be modeled as one that maximizes the efficiency in resource utilization while observing the constraints on CPU throughput, memory space available, maximally allowed task execution time, and the order of module execution. The CPU and memory constraints are implementation dependent. The maximum task execution time constraint is due to considerations on the response time performance. The constraint on module execution order is a logical one, and it is shown to have significant performance impact. It is proven that by employing the module precedence relation, which reflects the sequence of module execution, the order of module execution can be properly maintained during the software partitioning process. And thus the defined tasks can be guaranteed to be completely executable, once properly activated With completely executable tasks, the operating overhead cost and the response time delay can be minimized. The following four module precedence relations are explored: precede, succeed, parallel, and precede as well as succeed. The validity of the selected partitioning criterion of maximizing the resource utilization efficiency is also assessed through simulation experiments. The results of simulation show that performance of the selected criterion is insensitive to the application environment, as well as to the application requirements.

#* Atomic Remote Procedure Call
#@ Kwei-Jay Lin;John D. Gannon
#t 1985
#c IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering
#! Remote procedure call (RPC) is a programming primitive that makes building distributed programs easier. Atomicity, whkh implies totality and serializability, has been recognized as an important property to assure consistency in spite of computing node crashes. We have implemented an atomk remote procedure call mechanism which provides users a simple and reliable language primitive. Concurrency is controlled by attaching a call graph path identifier to each message representing a procedure call. Procedures keep their last accepted calling message paths to compare against incoming message paths. Only calls that can be serialized are accepted. Associated states of static variables are saved in backup processors on procedure entry and restored to corresponding variables in case of procedure crash. Detailed concurrency control and recovery algorithms are given, and illustrated with examples.

#* Synchronized Distributed Termination
#@ Boleslaw Szymanski;Yuan Shi;Noah S. Prywes
#t 1985
#c IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering
#! An efficient decentralized algorithm for synchronized termination of a distributed computation is presented. It is assumed that distributed processes are connected via unidirectional channels into a strongly connected network, in which no central controller exists. The number of processes and the network configuration are not known a priori. The number of steps required to terminate distributed computation after all processes met their local termination conditions is proportional to the diameter D of the network (D + 1 steps).

#* Stability and Distributed Scheduling Algorithms
#@ John A. Stankovic
#t 1985
#c IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering
#! Many distributed scheduling algorithms have been developed and reported in the current literature. However, very few of them explicitly treat stability issues. This paper first discusses stability issues for distributed scheduling algorithms in general terms. Two very different distributed scheduling algorithms which contain explicit mechanisms for stability are then presented and evaluated with respect to individual specific stability issues. One of the agorithms is based on stochastic learning automata and the other on bidding. The results indicate how very specific the treatment of stability is to the algorithm and environnent under consideration.

#* A Distributed Drafting Algorithm for Load Balancing
#@ Lionel M. Ni;Chong-Wei Xu;Thomas B. Gendreau
#t 1985
#c IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering
#! It is desirable for the load in a distributed system to be balanced evenly. A dynamic process migration protocol is needed in order to achieve load balancing in a user transparent manner. A distributed algorthim for load balancing which is network topology independent is proposed in this paper. Different network topologies and low-level communications protocols affect the choice of only some system design parameters. The "drafting" algorithm attempts to compromise two contradictory goals: maximize the processor utilization and minimize the communication overhead. The main objective of this paper is to describe the dynamic process migration protocol based on the proposed drafting algorithm. A sample distributed system is used to further illustrate the drafting algorithm and to show how to define system design parameters. The system performance is measured by simulation experiments based on the sample system.

#* An Empirical Study of Distributed Application Performance
#@ K. A. Lantz;William I. Nowicki;Marvin M. Theimer
#t 1985
#c IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering
#! A major reason for the rarity of distributed applications, despite the proliferation of networks, is the sensitivity of their performance to various aspects of the network environment. We demonstrate that distributed applications can run faster than local ones, using common hardware. We also show that the primary factors affecting performance are, in approximate order of importance: speed of the user's workstation, speed of the remote host (if any), and the high-level (above the transport level) protocols used. In particular, the use of batching, pipelining, and structure in high-level protocols reduces the degradation often experienced between different bandwidth networks. Less significant, but still noticeable improvements result from proper design and implementation of the underlying transport protocols. Ultimately, with proper application of these techniques, network bandwidth is rendered virtually insignificant.

#* An Analysis of the Effect of Network Parameters on the Performance of Distributed Database Systems
#@ Amit P. Sheth;Anoop Singhal;Ming T. Liu
#t 1985
#c IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering
#! Performance analysis studies of distributed database systems in the past have assumed that the message transmission time between any two nodes of a network is constant. They disregard the effect of communication network parameters such as network traffic, network topology, and capacity of transmission channels. In this paper, an analytical model is used to estimate the delays in transmission channels of the long haul network supporting the distributed database system. The analysis shows that the constant transmission time assumption cannot be justified in many cases, and that the response time is sensitive to the parameters mentioned above. Extensions and performance analysis in the context of interconnection networks are also discussed.

#* Reliability Optimization in the Design of Distributed Systems
#@ C. S. Raghavendra;Salim Hariri
#t 1985
#c IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering
#! The reliability of a distributed system depends on the reliabilities of its communication links and computing elements, as well as on the distribution of its resources, such as programs and data files. A useful measure of reliability in distributed systems is the terminal reliability between a pair of nodes which is the probability that at least one communication path exists between these nodes. An interesting optimization problem is that of maximizing the terminal reliability between a pair of computing elements under a given budget constraint. Analytical techniques to solve this problem are applicable only to special forms of reliability expressions. In this paper, three iterative algorithms for terminal reliability maximization are presented. The first two algorithms require the computation of terminal reliability expressions, and are therefore efficient for only small networks. The third algorithm, which is developed for large distributed systems, does not require the computation of terminal reliability expressions; this algorithm maximizes approximate objective functions and gives accurate results. Several examples are presented to illustrate the approximate optimization algorithm and an estimation of the error involved is also given.

#* Post-Failure Reconfiguration of CSP Programs
#@ Sol M. Shatz
#t 1985
#c IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering
#! In this paper a technique called process merging is introduced. This technique allows the merging of two communicating sequential processes into a new single process. Thus, this technique can be used to reconfigure a distributed program after a faulty processing element has been detected. The technique is most applicable to dedicated multiple microprocessor systems where the need for continuous operation is critical. A process merging algorithm which operates on distributed programs using the CSP notation is presented in detail and its operation is discussed. In order to illustrate the merging technique, the algorithm's behavior is demonstrated using two classical distributed programs: the Bounded Buffer, Producer, Consumer program and the Dining Philosophers program. Finally, the merging technique is examined with respect to its demands on overall system operation and overhead. This examinatiQn leads to suggestions for future research.

#* Integrated Performance Models for Distributed Processing in Computer Communication Networks
#@ Alexander Thomasian;Paul F. Bay
#t 1985
#c IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering
#! This paper deals with the analysis of large-scale closed queueing network (QN) models which are used for the performance analysis of computer communication networks (CCN's). The computer systems are interconnected by a wide-area network. Users accessing local/remote computers are affected by the contention (queueing delays) at the computer systems and the communication subnet. The computational cost of analyzing such models increases exponentially with the number of user classes (chains), even when the QN is tractable (product-form). In fact, the submodels of the integrated model are generally not product-form, e.g., due to blocking at computer systems (multiprogramming level constraints) and in the communication subnet (window flow control constraints). Two approximate solution methods are proposed in this paper to analyze the integrated QN model. Both methods use decomposition and iterative techniques to exploit the structure of the QN model such that computational cost is proportional to the number of chains. The accuracy of the solution methods is validated against each other and simulation. The model is used to study the effect that channel capacity assignments, window sizes for congestion control, and routing have on system performance.

#* An Approach to Performance Specification of Communication Protocols Using Timed Petri Nets
#@ Kumkum Garg
#t 1985
#c IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering
#! There has been a lot of interest in the past decade in using timed Petri nets to model computer systems. In this paper we show how such timed Petri nets can be used to great advantage in describing and algebraically specifying communication system performance. We make use of the time parameter of timed Petri nets to model the delay in performing certain operations of a communication protocol. The specification is borrowed from the recently reported AFFIRM language, and the protocol chosen for illustration is the ECMA transfer protocol, proposed for the ISO reference model. However, the methodology can be used with other protocols as well. We also show how liveness properties can be specified, easily using timed Petri nets.

#* Modeling and Analysis of Distributed Database Concurrency Control Algorithms Using an Extended Petri Net Formalism
#@ M. T. Ozsu
#t 1985
#c IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering
#! Distributed database systems (DDBS) have received considerable attention in recent years. Being a relatively young research field, there are still many problems associated with DDB systems that need solution. Concurrency control is one of these problems and, probably, the most extensively studied. However, most of the work has concentrated on the development of alternative solutions and the field seems to be ready for some comparative analysis work. This paper reports the results of a performance evaluation study on distributed database concurrency control algorithms. The research has resulted in the development of a formalism, based on Petri nets, for modeling and analysis purposes. The formalism, called the Extended Place/Transition Nets (EPTN), is both descriptively powerful in that it can be used to model various algorithms precisely and succinctly and to communicate them in a clear manner, while at the same time lending itself to be used as a performance evaluation tool. An EPTN simulator is implemented and various algorithms are studied using this tool. This paper describes both the formalism and the performance results that have been obtained.

#* Proving Liveness and Termination of Systolic Arrays Using Communicating Finite State Machines
#@ Mohamed G. Gouda;Hui-Seng Lee
#t 1985
#c IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering
#! We model a systolic array as a network of, mostly identical, communicating finite state machines that exchange messages over one-to-one, unbounded, FIFO channels. Each machine has a cyclic behavior; in each cycle, a machine first receives one message from each of its input channels, then sends one message to each of its output channels. If in a cycle a machine does not have any data message to send to one of its output channels, it sends a null message instead; thus, machines exchange two types of messages, data and null. We characterize the liveness and termination properties for such networks, and discuss two algorithms that can be used to decide these properties for any given network. We apply these algorithms to establish the liveness and termination properties of four systolic array examples. These examples include a linear matrix-vector multiplier, a linear priority queue, and a search tree.

Toward this end, key portions of a prototype environment, called CHI, were built that established the feasibility of this approach. One result of this research was the development of a wide-spectrum language that could be used to express all stages of the program development process in the system. Another result was that the prototype compiler was used to synthesize itself from very-high-level description of itself. In this way the system was bootstrapped. We describe the overall nature of the work done on this project, give highlights of implemented prototypes, and describe the implications that this work suggests for the future of software engineering. In addition to this historical perspective, current research projects at Kestrel Institute as well as commercial applications of the technology at Reasoning Systems are briefly surveyed.

The NIX project at Schlumberger-Doll Research has been investigating this issue in the context of two application domains related to oil well logging. Based on these experiments we have developed a framework for domain-specific automatic programming. Within the framework, programming is modeled in terms of two activities, formalization and implementation, each of which transforms descriptions of the program as it proceeds through intermediate states of development. The activities and transformations may be used to characterize the interaction of programming knowledge and domain knowledge in an automatic programming system.

#c IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering - Special issue on artificial intelligence and software engineering
#! A designer's expertise rests on the knowledge and skills which develop with experience in a domain. As a result, when a designer is designing an object in an unfamiliar domain he will not have the same knowledge and skills available to him as when he is designing an object in a familiar domain. In this paper we look at the software designer's underlying constellation of knowledge and skills, and at the way in which this constellation is dependent upon experience in a domain. What skills drop out, what skills, or interactions of skills come forward as experience with the domain changes? To answer the above question, we studied expert designers in experimentally created design contexts with which they were differentially familiar. In this paper we describe the knowledge and skills we found were central to each of the above contexts and discuss the functional utility of each. In addition to discussing the knowledge and skills we observed in expert designers, we will also compare novice and expert behavior.

Using these and other results from our research in artificial intelligence, we are building a system, DESIGNER, that automatically designs algorithms. This paper also compares developmental evaluation to execution and analysis techniques used for testing complete programs and for validation of abstract specifications; concepts similar to those found in developmental evaluation are thus shown to apply to all stages of the software life cycle.

We critically examine the basic features of Prolog from various perspectives to see to what extent they support (or hinder) expert system development. Our conclusion is that while Prolog has significant assets along several dimensions, Prolog as it exists today needs to be modified and appropriately enhanced to make it competitive to extant Lisp-based systems; we suggest the nature of some of these modifications.

#@ Daniel G. Bobrow
#t 1985
#c IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering - Special issue on artificial intelligence and software engineering
#! Knowledge programming, which makes use of the explicit representation and interpretation of knowledge to create intelligent programs, requires specialized languages and tools to help programmers. Prolog, an implementation of a logic programing language, provides some of these tools; it and other languages have been argued to be the "best" way to do such knowledge programming. This paper raises questions which suggest that any single paradigm of programming (e.g., logic programming or object-oriented programming) benefits by being integrated in a single environment with other paradigms of programming. Integration of these paradigms with each other, and within a flexible, user-friendly computing environment is also necessary. Such an environment must provide source level debugging and monitoring facilities, analysis and performance tuning tools, and an extended set of user communication programs.

In contrast, ADA defines the operations by means of model numbers and rounding (see [2], [11]). Nevertheless, this definition is not strong enough to satisfy the modern requirement of maximum accuracy in all spaces of scientific computation (see [7]-[9]). By this we mean that no computer representable element lies between the actual and the computer generated result of an operation. The object of this paper is to specify the new arithmetic in ADA for all usual numerical data types. The new arithmetic is made available in a convenient operator form.

Applications in which mnessage packets are of fixed length and shorter than the total inherent propagation delay around the ring are the focus of attention. Token, slotted, and static and dynamic insertion rings are included in the study. In all cases, the transmitting station is responsible for removing its transmitted packet from the ring. Under this type of removal rule, it is possible for the stations of all types of ring structures to execute their access control algorithms with only a short fixed in-line delay in each station. The insertion rings dynamically switch longer delays (insertion registers) into the ring when they are transmitting a packet. The transmitter-remove rule operates in such a way that hogging of the ring transmission facility by a subset of stations cannot occur. Expressions that approximate average transfer time as a function of utilization are derived for all ring types and are checked by simulation. The expressions are found to be quite accurate at low ring utilization levels, which is the case of most importance for LACN's; but some of them exhibit significant errors at high utilization levels. For the assumed, short-packet environment, it is found that token rings exhibit the slowest transfer times, while dynamic insertion rings are fastest.

#* A Database Machine for Very Large Relational Databases
#@ Ghassan Z. Qadah;K. B. Irani
#t 1985
#c IEEE Transactions on Computers
#! This paper presents an architectural design for a back-end database machine (DBM) suitable for supporting multiple-user, on-line, very large relational database systems (systems with capacities larger than 1010 bytes). This machine is called the Michigan Relational Database Machine (MIRDM). In designing such a machine a structured approach is followed. First, the DBM's proposed so far are reviewed using a novel classification scheme. Second, this review, the very large relational database system requirements, and the restrictions imposed by the current and near-future state of technology are used to formulate a set of design guidelines. Consequently, an architecture for a cost-effective DBM that meets this set of guidelines is synthesized. Some of the algorithms developed for implementing the primitives of the new machine are also presented. Finally, we highlight some of the important differences between the new DBM and some of the previously proposed ones.

#* Systematic Unidirectional Error-Detecting Codes
#@ Bella Bose;Der J. Lin

#! The theory and design of systematic t-unidirectional error-detecting codes are developed. Optimal systematic codes capable of detecting 2, 3, and 6 unidirectional errors using 2, 3, and 4 check bits, respectively, are given. For r =5 where r is the number of check bits, the systematic codes described here can detect up to 5· 2r-4 + r -4 unidirectional errors. Encoding/ decoding methods for these codes are also investigated.

#* Gracefully Degradable Processor Arrays
#@ Jose A. B. Fortes;C. S. Raghavendra
#t 1985
#c IEEE Transactions on Computers
#! A new approach to the design of gracefully degradable processor arrays is discussed. Fault tolerance and graceful degradation are achieved by simultaneously reconfiguring the processor array and the algorithm in execution. Two types of algorithm reconfigurability are considered, namely, row reconfigurability (RR) and row-column reconfigurability (RCR). correspondingly, two array reconfiguration schemes are discussed, i.e., successive row elimination (SRE) and alternate row-column elimination (ARCE). It is shown that the computations of any algorithm executable in a processor array can always be (re) organized so that the resultant algorithm has the RR and/or RCR properties. Upper bounds on the increase in execution time of an algorithm due to reorganization of computations for reconfigurability are derived. Detailed analysis of performance and reliability is done for both SRE and ARCE reconfiguration schemes. These reconfiguration techniques are applicable to any processor array and suitable for VLSI technology.

#@ Krishna Kant

#! The paper examines the problem of counting all interferences between a set of rectangular paths. Tight upper bounds on the number of overlaps and intersections between two or more rectangular paths are derived both for the general case and the special cases where the backtracking is not allowed in one or both directions. An optimal algorithm for counting all interferences for both the special and general cases is presented.

#! The formalization of the architecture of documents and text formatting are the central issues of this paper. Besides a fundamental and theoretical approach toward these topics, an overview is presented of the COBATEF system. The COBATEF system is a context-based text formatting system, for which a software, as well as a hardware, implementation is available.A unique feature of the system is its automatic text-element recognition mechanism, which is context based and consequently takes advantage of the implicit structure of text. A predefined layout for each type of text element then opens the way for a fully automatic text-processing system in which user control information can be reduced to an absolute minimum.

#! DITROFF/FFORTID, a collection of pre- and postprocessors for the UNIX DITROFF (Device Independent Typesetter RunOFF) is described. DITROFF/FFORTID permits formatting of text involving a mixture of languages written from left to right and from right to left, such as English and Hebrew. The programs are table driven or macro-generated to permit them to be used for any languages written from left to right and from right to left so long as fonts with the proper character sets can be mounted on a typesetting device supported by DITROFF. The preprocessors are set up to permit phonetic, unidirectional input of all of the alphabets needed using only the two alphabets (each case counts as an alphabet) available on the input device. These macro-generated preprocessors can be adjusted to the user's pronunciation, the language's rules about a letter's form, depending on its position in the word, and the language of the user's input keyboard. The postprocessor is set up to properly change direction of formatting when the text switches to a language written in a different direction. The collection of programs is also designed to allow use of any of DITROFF's preprocessors, such as PIC, EQN, TBL, and the various device drivers.

#! An imperative sentence processor that enables a user to manipulate text with connected speech and touch-graphics input is described. The processor includes capabilities to follow dialogue focus, execute a variety of imperative commands, and handle nested noun groups, pronouns, and other phenomena. A micromodel of the system, giving enough of the structure to enable the reader to observe internal mechanisms in considerable detail, is included. This processor is designed to be transportable to a number of other office automation domains such as calendar management, message-passing, and desk calculation. Various examples and statistics related to its behavior in the text manipulation application are given. The system has been implemented in PASCAL and can run on any machine that supports this language.

#! Two notions of dependency satisfaction, consistency and completeness, are introduced. Consistency is the natural generalization of weak-instance satisfaction and seems appropriate when only equality-generating dependencies are given, but disagrees with the standard notion in the presence of tuple-generating dependencies. Completeness is based on the intuitive semantics of tuple-generating dependencies but differs from the standard notion for equality-generating dependencies. It is argued that neither approach is the correct one, but rather that they correspond to different policies on constraint enforcement, and each one is appropriate in different circumstances. Consistency and completeness of a state are characterized in terms of the tableau associated with the state and in terms of logical properties of a set of first-order sentences associated with the state. A close relation between the problems of testing for consistency and completeness and of testing implication of dependencies is established, leading to lower and upper bounds for the complexity of consistency and completeness. The possibility of formalizing dependency satisfaction without using a universal relation scheme is examined.

#! A high-resolution raster-graphics display is usually combined with processing power and a memory organization that facilitates basic graphics operations. For many applications, including interactive text processing, the ability to quickly move or copy small rectangles of pixels is essential. This paper proposes a novel organization of raster-graphics memory that permits all small rectangles to be moved efficiently. The memory organization is based on a doubly periodic assignment of pixels to M memory chips according to a “Fibonacci” lattice. The memory organization guarantees that, if a rectilinearly oriented rectangle contains fewer than M/ @@@@5 pixels, then all pixels will reside in different memory chips and thus can be accessed simultaneously. Moreover, any M consecutive pixels, arranged either horizontally or vertically, can be accessed simultaneously.We also define a continuous analog of the problem, which can be posed as: “What is the maximum density of a set of points in the plane such that no two points are contained in the interior of a rectilinearly oriented rectangle of unit area?” We show the existence of such a set with density 1/ @@@@5, and prove this is optimal by giving a matching upper bound.

#! Given a nonnegative, irreducible matrix P of spectral radius unity, there exists a positive vector &pgr; such that &pgr; = &pgr;P. If P also happens to be stochastic, then &pgr; gives the stationary distribution of the Markov chain that has state-transition probabilities given by the elements of P. This paper gives an algorithm for computing &pgr; that is particularly well suited for parallel processing. The main attraction of our algorithm is that the timing and sequencing restrictions on individual processors are almost entirely eliminated and, consequently, the necessary coordination between processors is negligible and the enforced idle time is also negligible.Under certain mild and easily satisfied restrictions on P and on the implementation of the algorithm, x(.), the vectors of computed values are proved to converge to within a positive, finite constant of proportionality of &pgr;. It is also proved that a natural measure of the projective distance of x(.) from &pgr; vanishes geometrically fast, and at a rate for which a lower bound is given. We have conducted extensive experiments on random matrices P, and the results show that the improvement over the parallel implementation of the synchronous version of the algorithm is substantial, sometimes exceeding the synchronization penalty to which the latter is always subject.

#! An analytic model is used to study the performance of dynamic locking. The analysis uses only the steady-state average values of the variables. The solution to the model is given by a cubic, which has exactly one valid root for the range of parametric values that is of interest. The model's predictions agree well with simulation results for transactions that require up to twenty locks. The model separates data contention from resource contention, thus facilitating an analysis of their separate effects and their interaction. It shows that systems with a particular form of nonuniform access, or with shared locks, are equivalent to systems with uniform access and only exclusive locks.Blocking due to conflicts is found to impose an upper bound on transaction throughput; this fact leads to a rule of thumb on how much data contention should be permitted in a system. Throughput can exceed this bound if a transaction is restarted whenever it encounters a conflict, provided restart costs and resource contention are low. It can also be exceeded by making transactions predeclare their locks. Raising the multiprogramming level to increase throughput also raises the number of restarts per completion. Transactions should minimize their lock requests, because data contention is proportional to the square of the number of requests. The choice of how much data to lock at a time depends on which part of a general granularity curve the system sees.

These rules, the relation replacement and relation matching rules, generalize to an arbitrary binary relation the paramodulation and E-resolution rules, respectively, for equality, and may operate within a nonclausal or clausal system. The new rules depend on an extension of the notion of polarity to apply to subterms as well as to subsentences, with respect to a given binary relation. The rules allow us to eliminate troublesome axioms, such as transitivity and monotonicity, from the system; proofs are shorter and more comprehensible, and the search space is correspondingly deflated.

#! In spite of the wide variety of concurrency control and recovery mechanisms proposed during the past decade, the behavior and the performance of various concurrency control and recovery mechanisms remain largely not well understood. In addition, although concurrency control and recovery mechanisms are intimately related, the interaction between them has not been adequately explored. In this paper, we take a unified view of the problems associated with concurrency control and recovery for transaction-oriented multiuser centralized database management systems, and we present several integrated mechanisms. We then develop analytical models to study the behavior and compare the performance of these integrated mechanisms, and we present the results of our performance evaluation.

#@ J. W. Wong;M. H. Ammar

#c IEEE Transactions on Computers
#! Videotex is a system which provides users with low-cost real-time access to information. In such a system, user requests are forwarded to a service computer where the desired information is retrieved and sent back to the user. In this study, we investigate the response time behavior of a videotex system where information requested by one user is broadcast to all users. A novel queueing model for broadcast delivery is developed. Using this model, we first obtain an analytic expression for the mean response time, and then we develop an efficient algorithm for its computation. Numerical results illustrating the performance characteristics of broadcast delivery are presented.

#* Fast Constant Division Routines
#@ Shuo-Yen R. Li
#t 1985
#c IEEE Transactions on Computers
#! When there is no division circuit available, the arithmetical function of division is normally performed by a library subroutine. The library subroutine normally allows both the divisor and the dividend to be variables, and requires the execution of hundreds of assembly instructions. This correspondence provides a fast algorithm for performing the integer division of a variable by a predetermined divisor. Based upon this algorithm, an efficient division routine has been constructed for each odd divisor up to 55. These routines may be implemented in assembly languages, in microcodes, and in special-purpose circuits.

#* An Approximation Algorithm for Diagnostic Test Scheduling in Multicomputer Systems
#@ Henryk Krawczyk
#t 1985
#c IEEE Transactions on Computers
#! The problem of diagnostic test scheduling (DTS) is to assign to each edge e of a diagnostic graph G a time interval of length l(e) so that intervals corresponding to edges at any given vertex do not overlap and the overall finishing time is minimum. In this correspondence we show that the DTS problem is NP-complete. Then we present a longest, first sequential scheduling algorithm which runs in worst case time O(dm log n) and uses O(m) space to produce a solution of length less than four times optimal. Then we show that the general performance bound can be strengthened to 3 * OPT(G) for low-degree graphs and to 2 ·OPT(G) in some special cases of binomial diagnostic graphs.

Unlike previously proposed bounding algorithms, the algorithm is applicable to all of the types of product-form queuing networks that are commonly used in computer system and computer-communication network applications.

#! Elementary translations between various kinds of recursive trees are presented. It is shown that trees of either finite or countably infinite branching can be effectively put into one-one correspondence with infinitely branching trees in such a way that the infinite paths of the latter correspond to the “P-abiding” infinite paths of the former. Here P can be any member of a very wide class of properties of infinite paths. For many properties ??, the converse holds too. Two of the applications involve (a) the formulation of large classes of highly undecidable variants of classical computational problems, and in particular, easily describable domino problems that are III11-complete, and (b) the existence of a general method for proving termination of nondeterministic or concurrent programs under any reasonable notion of fairness.

#! In this paper an O(N log N) algorithm for routing through a rectangle is presented. Consider an n-by-m rectangular grid and a set of N two-terminal nets. A net is a pair of points on the boundary of the rectangle. A layout is a set of edge-disjoint paths, one for each net. Our algorithm constructs a layout, if there is one, in O(N log N) time; this contrasts favorably with the area of the layout that might be as large as N2. The layout constructed can be wired using four layers of interconnect with only O(N) contact cuts. A partial extension to multiterminal nets is also discussed.

#! An exception-handling facility suitable for languages used to implement database-intensive information systems is presented. Such a mechanism facilitates the development and maintenance of more flexible software systems by supporting the abstraction of details concerning special or abnormal occurrences. The type constraints imposed by the schema as well as various semantic integrity assertions are considered to be normalcy conditions, and the key contribution of this work is to allow exceptions to these constraints to persist. To achieve this, solutions are proposed to a range of problems, including sharing and computing with exceptional information, exception handling by users, the logic of constraints with exceptions, and implementation issues. The use of exception handling in dealing with null values, estimates, and measurement is also illustrated.

#! Computer music is a relatively new field. While a large proportion of the public is aware of computer music in one form or another, there seems to be a need for a better understanding of its capabilities and limitations in terms of synthesis, performance, and recording hardware. This article addresses that need by surveying and discussing the architecture of existing computer music systems.System requirements vary according to what the system will be used for. Common uses for computer music systems include composition, performance, research, home entertainment, and studio recording/mixing. This paper outlines system components with this wide diversity of possible uses in mind.Current synthesis and analysis techniques, and the different way in which these techniques can be implemented in special-purpose hardware, are comprehensively reviewed. Design specifications are given for certain digital-to-analog (and analog-to-digital) converters, disk interfaces, system organization, control hardware and software, and numerical precision.Several synthesis systems are described in detail, with an emphasis on theoretical developments and innovative design. Commercial synthesizers and other architectures are also briefly mentioned.

#! A hypergraph formalism is introduced to represent database schemata. In particular, a database schema B, described by one full join dependency and a set of functional dependencies, is represented by a (database) hypergraph H, containing both undirected and directed hyperedges. Undirected hyperedges correspond to the relations in the join dependency, and directed hyperedges correspond to the functional dependencies. In addition, two classes of database hypergraphs are defined: e-acyclic hypergraphs and e-independent hypergraphs. A hypergraph is e-acyclic if it is equivalent to some acyclic hypergraph; it is e-independent if it is equivalent to some independent (i.e., cover-embedding) hypergraph. Furthermore, the closure of a database hypergraph is defined as the extension of the transitive closure of a graph. By using a lower bound and an upper bound of the hypergraph closure (called L-closure and U-closure, respectively), it is proved that two e-acyclic (e-independent) hypergraphs are equivalent if and only if they have the same closure. Moreover, a hypergraph is e-acyclic (e-independent) if and only if its closure is acyclic (independent) and, in most cases, such a recognition can be done in polynomial time. Finally, it is shown how to use the database hypergraph closure to solve some database design problems.

#* On ordered languages and the optimization of linear functions by greedy algorithms
#@ Ulrich Faigle
#t 1985

#% 547091
#! The optimization problem for linear functions on finite languages is studied, and an (almost) complete characterization of those functions for which a primal and a dual greedy algorithm work well with respect to a canonically associated linear programming problem is given. The discussion in this paper is within the framework of ordered languages, and the characterization uses the notion of rank feasibility of a weighting with respect to an ordered language. This yields a common generalization of a sufficient condition, obtained recently by Korte and Lovász for greedoids, and the greedy algorithm for ordered sets in Faigel's paper [6]. Ordered greedoids are considered the appropriate generalization of greedoids, and the connection is established between ordered languages, polygreedoids, and Coxeteroids. Answering a question of Björner, the author shows in particular that a polygreedoid is a Coxeteroid if and only if it is derived from an integral polymatroid.

#! The differences between and appropriateness of branching versus linear time temporal logic for reasoning about concurrent programs are studied. These issues have been previously considered by Lamport. To facilitate a careful examination of these issues, a language, CTL*, in which a universal or existential path quantifier can prefix an arbitrary linear time assertion, is defined. The expressive power of a number of sublanguages is then compared. CTL* is also related to the logics MPL of Abrahamson and PL of Harel, Kozen, and Parikh. The paper concludes with a comparison of the utility of branching and linear time temporal logics.

#! Consider a network of communicating finite state machines that exchange messages over unbounded FIFO channels. Each machine in the network can be defined by a directed graph whose nodes represent the machine states and whose edges represent its transitions. In general, for a node in one of the machines to be live (i.e., encountered infinitely often during the course of communication), each machine in the network should progress in some fair fashion. We define three graduated notions of fair progress (namely, node fairness, edge fairness, and network fairness), and on this basis we define three corresponding degrees of node liveness. We discuss techniques to verify that a given node is live under each of these fairness assumptions. These techniques can be automated; and they are effective even if the network under consideration has an infinite number of reachable states. We use our techniques to establish the liveness of some practical communication protocols; these include an unbounded start-stop protocol, an unbounded alternating bit protocol, and a simplified version of the CSMA/CD protocol for local area networks.

#! In Part 1 of this paper [5], we presented a scheme whereby a compiler could propagate demands through programs in a powerful stream language L. A data-driven evaluation of the transformed program performed exactly the same computation as a demand-driven evaluation of the original program. In this paper we explore a different transformation, which trades the complexity of demand propagation for a bounded amount of extra computation on some data lines.

#! The “referential transparency” principle of applicative language expressions stipulates that a single value exists for all occurrences of an expression in a given context (where a context is a set of bindings of variables to values). In principle, each such value therefore need to be computed only once. However, in applicative language systems supporting recursive programming or tasking notions, the bindings are not all precomputed and explicit. As a result, textual recognition of all multipleoccurrences is precluded, with the unfortunate consequence that such occurrences are recomputed. We elaborate upon the early notion of “memo function” for solving this problem. We suggest syntactic and semantic constructs providing programmer control for avoiding recomputation, which is incorporated into a “building-block” approach.

#! A framework is presented for adding a general Undo facility to programming languages. A discussion of relevant literature is provided to show that the idea of Undoing pervades several areas in computer science, and even other disciplines. A simple model of computation is introduced, and it is augmented with a minimal amount of additional structure needed for recovery and reversal. Two different interpretations of Undo are motivated with examples. Then, four primitives are defined in a language-independent manner; they are sufficient to support a wide range of Undo capability. Two of these primitives carry out state saving, and the others mirror the two versions of the Undo operation. Properties of and relationships between these primitives are explored, and there are some preliminary remarks on how one could implement a system based on this formalism. The main conclusion is that the notions of recovery and reversal of actions can become part of the programming process.

#! The problem of concurrent accesses to registers by asynchronous components is considered. A set of axioms about the values in a register during concurrent accesses is proposed. It is shown that if these axioms are met by a register, then concurrent accesses to it may be viewed as nonconcurrent, thus making it possible to analyze asynchronous algorithms without elaborate timing analysis of operations. These axioms are shown, in a certain sense, to be the weakest. Motivation for this work came from analyzing low-level hardware components in a VLSI chip which concurrently accesses a flip-flop.

Thus, the space in the PLA is saved, estimated at only 15.94 percent of the space for a readonly memory (ROM) counterpart.

#@ David B. Aspinwall;Yale N. Patt
#t 1985
#c IEEE Transactions on Computers
#! The VAX-11/7801 was designed specifically to implement the VAX architecture. As such, it does not support the IEEE standard for floating point arithmetic. A project was undertaken to provide this support by modifying the 11/780 microarchitecture. Our objective was to produce a microengine that would efficiently execute the VAX instruction set, modified to handle VAX floating point instructions in accordance with the IEEE standard. Our methodology was to make minimal changes to the 11/780 hardware, relying primarily on changes to the microcode. This paper describes the modifications required to implement the IEEE standard, examines the various design alternatives available to us, presents measurements of our implementation, and analyzes our results. We also offer some comments on the matter of retrofitting an existing architecture to a new unintended use.

#@ Charles C. Wang;T. K. Truong;Howard M. Shao;Leslie J. Deutsch;Jim K. Omura;Irving S. Reed
#t 1985
#c IEEE Transactions on Computers
#! Finite field arithmetic logic is central in the implementation of Reed-Solomon coders and in some cryptographic algorithms. There is a need for good multiplication and inversion algorithms that can be easily realized on VLSI chips. Massey and Omura [1] recently developed a new multiplication algorithm for Galois fields based on a normal basis representation. In this paper, a pipeline structure is developed to realize the Massey-Omura multiplier in the finite field GF(2m). With the simple squaring property of the normal basis representation used together with this multiplier, a pipeline architecture is also developed for computing inverse elements in GF(2m). The designs developed for the Massey-Omura multiplier and the computation of inverse elements are regular, simple, expandable, and therefore, naturally suitable for VLSI implementation.

#* Self-Implicating Structures for Diagnosable Systems
#@ Anton T. Dahbura;Gerald M. Masson;Che-Liang Yang
#t 1985
#c IEEE Transactions on Computers
#! In this paper, a new class of diagnosable systems, called tp-self-implicating systems, which is a special case of the well-known tp-diagnosable systems introduced by Preparata et al. [1], is described. If there are no more than tp faulty units and the faults are assumed to be permanent, then the faulty units in a tp-self-implicating system can always be identified using at least one of two straight forward criteria associated with test outcomes. In each case, the given faulty unit in effect implicates itself as faulty. Necessary and sufficient conditions are given on the structures of PMC models for self-implication. Finally, an algorithm for identifying the set of faulty units in a tp-self-implicating system is given which is linear in the number of tests in the system, rendering it more efficient than the most efficient known algorithm for the general class of tp-diagnosable systems.

#* Square-Rooting Algorithms for High-Speed Digital Circuits
#@ Stanislaw Majerski
#t 1985
#c IEEE Transactions on Computers
#! Two binary algorithms for the square rooting of a number or of a sum of two numbers are presented. They are based on the classical nonrestoring method. The main difference lies in the replacement of subtractions and additions by a parallel reduction f three summands, which may be positive and negative, to two summands to eliminate the carry propagation. Two of three summands form the successive partial remainder. Their most significant bit triples, sometimes together with a sign bit of the earlier partial remainder, are used to determine digits -1,0, +1 of a redundant square-root notation. These digits are transformed during the square-rooting process into the conventional notation square-root bits which are next used in further square-rooting steps to form the third reduced summands.

#* Synchronizing Large VLSI Processor Arrays
#@ Allan L. Fisher;H. T. Kung
#t 1985
#c IEEE Transactions on Computers
#! Highly parallel VLSI computing structures consist of many processing elements operating simultaneously. In order for such processing elements to communicate among themselves, some provision must be made for synchronization of data transfer. The simplest means of synchronization is the use of a global clock. Unfortunately, large clocked systems can be difficult to implement because of the inevitable problem of clock skews and delays, which can be especially acute in VLSI systems as feature sizes shrink. For the near term, good engineering and technology improvements can be expected to maintain the feasibility of clocking in such systems; however, clock distribution problems crop up in any technology as systems grow. An alternative means of enforcing necessary synchronization is the use of self-timed asynchronous schemes, at the cost of increased design complexity and hardware cost. Realizing that different circumstances call for different synchronization methods, this paper provides a spectrum of synchronization models; based on the assumptions made for each model, theoretical lower bounds on clock skew are derived, and appropriate or best possible synchronization schemes for large processor arrays are proposed.

#* A Fast Serial-Parallel Binary Multiplier
#@ R. Gnanasekaran
#t 1985
#c IEEE Transactions on Computers
#! A fast serial-parallel (FSP) multiplier design is derived from the carry-save add-shift (CSAS) multiplier structure. The CSAS technique accepts multiplier bits serially (lsb first) and produces outputs serially (lsb first). Multiplication of two n bit unsigned numbers requires 2n clock cycles to complete the process out of which n clocks are used for n-row carry-save additions, and the other n clocks are utilized only to propagate the remaining carries. This CSAS structure is modified so that it operates as a CSAS unit for the first n clocks and reconfigures itself as an n bit ripple-carry parallel adder at the (n + 1)st clock, thus allowing the carries to ripple through, eliminating the delay due to storage elements during the last n clocks. It is shown that this modification results in an about one-third increase in speed for an approximately one-third increase in hardware. The technique is extended to signed numbers represented in 2's complement form. Also, it is shown how these implementations can be modularized.

#* General Model for Memory Interference in Multiprocessors and Mean Value Analysis
#@ Bohdan Šmilauer
#t 1985
#c IEEE Transactions on Computers
#! This correspondence seeks to generalize and clarify the general model for memory interference (GMI) in multiprocessors as proposed by Hoogendoorn. The interference model creates a queueing network where some service centers are FCFS with constant service times; therefore, we also apply the mean value analysis (MVA) approxdmation suggested by Reiser to solve this model. Furthermore, we reduce the computations in this approximation by applying the iterative scheme suggested by Schweitzer. Although many authors have studied the memory interference problem, nobody has used the above-mentioned MVA approximations. We study these MVA approximations in the context of the memory interference problem and show that they produce better results with much less computation.

Although synchronization can be achieved via both software (e.g., interactive convergence and interactive consistency algorithms) and hardware (e.g., multistage synchronizers and phase-locked clocks), phase-locked clocks are most attractive due to their small overheads.

#* A Totally Self-Checking Error Indicator
#@ N. Gaitanis
#t 1985
#c IEEE Transactions on Computers
#! This correspondence presents a totally self-checking error indicator for solving the practical problem of monitoring the TSC checkers. We consider TSC checkers designed for checking coded information (data or address) or periodic signals with tolerable transient failures smaller than a constant time limit T, which depends on the propagation delay of the used logic elements. This circuit provides normal indication outputs (01) or (10) and error indication outputs (11) or (00). Permanent failures or transient failures with time duration greater than T result in a permanent error indication, which remains until reset. Provided that an assumed fault occurs within the checker, the permanent error indication output is produced at most after four input changes from (01) to (10) or from (10) to (01).

#@ Vijay Pitchumani;Edward P. Stabler

#! This correspondence presents a method for proof of correctness of register transfer level (RTL) parallel control sequences that describe hardware behavior. An RTL language endowed with parallel constructs is presented and its semantics is defined. The semantics includes temporal behavior. An assertion-based proof method is presented for verification of parallel control sequences described in this language. An example is given and comparisons are drawn between proofs of parallel register transfer level sequences and parallel programs. The temporal semantics associated with the language permits the construction and proof of parallel sequences that are not possible with parallel programs. Accessing shared resources outside critical regions is possible and is illustrated.

The proposed network is left-right and top-down symmetric and is planar. Every node in the interconnection network has the same number of degree, 3. There are multiple paths between any two nodes in the network. Results of the message traffic analysis of the network are presented.

Procedures are given to test whether two such networks are equivalent. Whenever they are, these procedures also produce a map to conjugate one network onto the other.

#! A technique for partitioning and mapping algorithms into VLSI systolic arrays is presented in this paper. Algorithm partitioning is essential when the size of a computational problem is larger than the size of the VLSI array intended for that problem. Computational models are introduced for systolic arrays and iterative algorithms. First, we discuss the mapping of algorithms into arbitrarily large size VLSI arrays. This mapping is based on the idea of algorithm transformations. Then, we present an approach to algorithm partitioning which is also based on algorithm transformations. Our approach to the partitioning problem is to divide the algorithm index set into bands and to map these bands into the processor space. The partitioning and mapping technique developed throughout the paper is summarized as a six step procedure. A computer program implementing this procedure was developed and some results obtained with this program are presented.

#! Two sets of conditions are derived that make one- dimensional bilateral arrays of combinational cells testable for single faulty cells. The test sequences are preset and, in the worst case, grow quadratically with the size of the array. Conditions for testability in linear time are also derived. The basic cell can operate at the bit or at the word level. An implementation of FIR filters using (systolic) one-dimensional bilateral arrays of cells, which can be considered combinational at the word level, is presented as an example. A straightforward generalization for the two- dimensional case is made; a systolic array used for matrix multiplication is presented as an example for this case.

The principles of data flow computing are carefully considered in order to conform with the special properties of DSP. The bus oriented architecture is easily configured to meet various performance requirements. The DFSP architecture is most suitable for nonrecursive algorithms. Typical tasks of this nature are transforms and FIR filters. A simulation model of the DFSP architecture has been developed. Simulation results of two application examples are given.

In this paper we present two algorithms. The first algorithm generates parallel suffix solutions with minimum cost for a given length, time delay, availability of initial values, and fanout. This algorithm generates a minimal solution for any length n and depth range from log2 n to n. The second algorithm reduces the size of the solutions generated by the first algorithm.

#! One class of reconfigurable parallel processing systems is based on the use of a large number of processing elements which can be partitioned into multiple virtual machines. Each virtual machine is controlled by one or more control units. The multiple control units in such a system share a common secondary storage for programs. The control units use paging to transfer programs to their primary memories. One design problem is determining the optimal service rate for the secondary storage of the control units, where the "optimal" is characterized by maximum processor utilization. The PASM parallel processing system is used as a example system to study this problem. The implementation of virtual memory on the PASM control system memory hierarchy is discussed and a queueing network model for the memory hierarchy is developed. Based on assumed values for parameters that characterize the expected task environment, an optimal service rate is derived from the model. The values of the parameters in the model can be varied to determine the impact these changes would have on system performance. Simulation results verifying various aspects of the model are presented and the results are generalized.

#! An approximation for the distribution of time delays experienced by a customer in a network of queues is presented. Approximate analytical models are necessary since exact solutions are only available for a very restricted class of networks, and are too complex computationally to be viable in practice. Approximations have so far often proved inadequate, particularly for closed networks with first come first served queueing disciplines. We also prove that the correlation between the sojourn times at successive servers on a customer's path in a closed queueing network with exponential servers is negative.

#* Equational methods in first order predicate calculus

#! We show that the application of the resolution principle to a set of clauses can be regarded as the construction of a term rewriting system confluent on valid formulas. This result allows the extension of usual properties and methods of equational theories (such as Birkhoff's theorem and the Knuth and Bendix completion algorithm) to quantifier-free first order theories. These results are extended to first order predicate calculus in an equational theory, as studied by Plotkin (1972), Slagle (1974) and Lankford (1975). This paper is a continuation of the work of Hsiang & Dershowitz (1983), who have already shown that rewrite methods can be used in first order predicate calculus. The main difference is the following: Hsiang uses rewrite methods only as a refutational proof technique, the initial set of formulas being unsatisfiable iff the equation TRUE = FALSE is generated by the completion algorithm. We generalise these methods to satisfiable theories; in particular, we show that the concept of confluent rewriting system, which is the main tool for studying equational theories, can be extended to any quantifier-free first order theory. Furthermore, we show that rewrite methods can be used even if formulas are kept in clausal form.

#! In this paper the set of first order substitutions with a partial ordering ''more general than'' is investigated. It is proved that the set of equivalence classes of idempotent substitutions together with an added greatest element is a complete lattice. A simultaneous unification of finitely many finite sets of terms can be reduced to unifying each of the sets of terms separately and to building the supremum of the most general unifiers in this lattice afterwards. This saves time in an automatic proof procedure when combined with the concept of weak unification also introduced in this paper.

#! Let P be a set of n points in the Euclidean plane and let C be a convex figure. We study the problem of preprocessing P so that for any query point q, the points of P in C+q can be retrieved efficiently. If constant time sumces for deciding the inclusion of a point in C, we then demonstrate the existence of an optimal solution: the algorithm requires O(n) space and O(k + log n) time for a query with output size k. If C is a disk, the problem becomes the wellknown fixed-radius neighbour problem, to which we thus provide the first known optimal solution.

#! We present a fast parallel deterministic algorithm for testing multivariate integral polynomials for absolute irreducibility, that is irreducibility over the complex numbers. More precisely, we establish that the set of absolutely irreducible integral polynomials belongs to the complexity class NC of Boolean circuits of polynomial size and logarithmic depth. Therefore it also belongs to the class of sequentially polynomial-time problems. Our algorithm can be extended to compute in parallel one irreducible complex factor of a multivariate integral polynomial. However, the coeffieients of the computed factor are only represented modulo a not necessarily irreducible polynomial specifying a splitting field. A consequence of our algorithm is that multivariate polynomials over finite fields can be tested for absolute irreducibility in deterministic sequential polynomial time in the size of the input. We also obtain a sharp bound for the last prime p for which, when taking an absolute irreducible integral polynomial modulo p, the polynomial's irreducibility in the algebraic closure of the finite field of order p is not preserved.

#! A descriptive, non-technical tutorial on MACSYMA, a well-known and widely used Computer Algebra system, is presented. Several examples of its capabilities are exhibited using actual MACSYMA input and output. A discussion of computer-based symbolic mathematical computation is motivated by pointing out inherent difficulties with familiar numeric computations. The inner workings of Computer Algebra systems are briefly discussed in addition to some on-going work on MACSYMA and future directions.

#! In [10] a method is proposed for decomposing join dependencies (jds) in a relational database using the notion of a hinge. This method was subsequently studied in [11] and [12]. We show how the technique of decomposition can be used to make integrity checking more efficient. It turns out that it is important to find a decomposition that minimizes the number of edges of its largest element. We show that the decompositions obtained with the method described in [10] are optimal in this respect. This minimality criterion leads to the definition of the degree of cyclicity, which allows us to classify jds and leads to the notion of n-cyclicity, of which acyclicity is a special case for n = 2. We then show that, for a fixed value of n (which may be greater than 2). integrity checking can be performed in polynomial time provided we restrict ourselves to n-cyclic jds. Finally, we generalize a well-known characterization for acyclic jds by proving that n-cyclicity is equivalent to “n-wise consistency implies global consistency.” As a consequence, consistency checking can be performed in polynomial time if we restrict ourselves to n-cyclic jds, for a tired value of n, not necessarily equal to 2.

#! This paper analyzes the problem of joining two horizontally partitioned relations in a distributed database system. Two types of semijoin strategies are introduced, local and remote. Local semijoins are performed at the site of the restricted relation (or fragment), and remote semijoins can be performed at an arbitrary site. A mathematical model of a semijoin strategy for the case of remote semijoins is developed, and lower bounding and heuristic procedures are proposed. The results of computational experiments are reported. The experiments include an analysis of the heuristics' performance relative to the lower bounds, sensitivity analysis, and error analysis. These results reveal a good performance of the heuristic procedures, and demonstrate the benefit of using semijoin operations to reduce the size of fragments prior to their transmission. The algorithms for the case of remote semijoins were found to be superior to the algorithms for the case of local semijoins. In addition, we found that the estimation accuracy of the selectivity factors has a significant effect on the incurred communication cost.

#! The growing acceptance of database systems makes their performance increasingly more important. One way to gain performance is to off-load some of the functions of the database system to aback-end computer. The problem is what functions should be off-loaded to maximize the benefits of distributed processing.Our approach to this problem consisted of constructing several variants of an existing relational database system. INGRES, that partition the database system software into two parts, and assigning these two parts to two computers connected by a local area network. For the purposes of this experiment, six different variants of the database software were constructed to test the sir most interesting functional subdivisions. Each variant was then benchmarked using two different databases and query streams. The communication medium and the communication software were also benchmarked to measure their contribution to the performance of each configuration.Combining the database and network measurement results, various conclusions were reached about the viability of the configurations, the desirable properties of the communications mechanisms to he used, the operating system interface and overhead, and the performance of the database system. The variants to be preferred depend on the hardware technology, operating system features, database system internal structure, and network software overhead.

#! In this paper we study when and how B Byzantine agreement protocol can he used in general-purpose database management systems. We present an overview of the failure model used for Byzantine agreement, and of the protocol itself. We then present correctness criteria for database processing in this failure environment and discuss strategies for satisfying them. In doing this, we present new failure models for input/output nodes and study ways to distribute input transactions to processing nodes under these models. Finally, we investigate applications of Byzantine agreement protocols in the more common failure environment where processors are assumed to halt after a failure.

#! A novel formal theory of concurrent systems that does not assume any atomic operations is introduced. The execution of a concurrent program is modeled as an abstract set of operation executions with two temporal ordering relations: “precedence” and “can causally affect”. A primitive interprocess communication mechanism is then defined. In Part II, the mutual exclusion is expressed precisely in terms of this model, and solutions using the communication mechanism are given.

#! The problem of partitioning a polygonal region into a minimum number of trapezoids with two horizontal sides is discussed. A triangle with a horizontal side is considered to be a trapezoid with two horizontal sides one of which is degenerate. First, a method of achieving a minimum partition is presented. The number M* of the trapezoids in the minimum partition of a polygonal region P is shown to be M* = n + w - h - d - 1, where n, w, and h are the number of vertices, windows (holes), and horizontal edges of P, respectively, and d is the cardinality of a maximum independent set of the straight-lines-in-the-plane graph associated with P. Next, this problem is shown to be polynomially equivalent to the problem of finding a maximum independent set of a straight-lines-in-the-plane graph, and consequently, it is shown to be NP-complete. However, for a polygonal region without windows, an O(n2)-time algorithm for partitioning it into a minimum number of trapezoids is presented. Finally, an O(n log n)-time approximation algorithm with the performance bound 3 is presented.

#! A sound and, in certain cases, complete method is described for evaluating queries in relational databases with null values where these nulls represent existing but unknown individuals. The soundness and completeness results are proved relative to a formalization of such databases as suitable theories of first-order logic. Because the algorithm conforms to the relational algebra, it may easily be incorporated into existing relational systems.

#! A major event in automated reasoning was the introduction by Robinson of resolution as an inference principle that is complete for the first-order predicate calculus. Here the theory of binary resolution, based strictly on unification, is recast to incorporate the axioms of equality. Equality-based binary resolution is complete without making use of paramodulation and leads to refutations that are less than half as long as standard refutations with the equality axioms. A detailed discussion is given of the first major use of a theorem prover based on this new method.

#! PARLOG is a logic programming language in the sense that nearly every definition and query can be read as a sentence of predicate logic. It differs from PROLOG in incorporating parallel modes of evaluation. For reasons of efficient implementation, it distinguishes and separates and-parallel and or-parallel evaluation.PARLOG relations are divided into two types: single-solution relations and all-solutions relations. A conjunction of single-solution relation calls can be evaluated in parallel with shared variables acting as communication channels for the passing of partial bindings. Only one solution to each call is computed, using committed choice nondeterminism.A conjunction of all-solutions relation calls is evaluated without communication of partial bindings, but all the solutions may be found by an or-parallel exploration of the different evaluation paths. A set constructor provides the main interface between single-solution relations and all-solutions relations.This paper is a tutorial introduction to PARLOG. It assumes familiarity with logic programming. Categories and Subject Descriptors: D.l.l [Programming Techniques]: Applicative (Functional)

#! An explicit steady-state solution is given for any queuing loop made up of two general servers, whose distribution functions have rational Laplace transforms. The solution is in matrix geometric form over a vector space that is itself a direct or Kronecker product of the internal state spaces of the two servers. The algebraic properties of relevant entities in this space are given in an appendix. The closed-form solution yields simple recursive relations that in turn lead to an efficient algorithm for calculating various performance measures such as queue length and throughput. A computational-complexity analysis shows that the algorithm requires at least an order of magnitude less computational effort than any previously reported algorithm.

#! Modeling the storage structures of a DBMS is a prerequisite to understanding and optimizing database performance. Previously, such modeling was very difficult because the fundamental role of conceptual-to-internal mappings in DBMS implementations went unrecognized.In this paper we present a model of physical databases, called the transformation model, that makes conceptual-to-internal mappings explicit. By exposing such mappings, we show that it is possible to model the storage architectures (i.e., the storage structures and mappings) of many commercial DBMSs in a precise, systematic, and comprehendible way. Models of the INQUIRE, ADABAS, and SYSTEM 2000 storage architectures are presented as examples of the model's utility.We believe the transformation model helps bridge the gap between physical database theory and practice. It also reveals the possibility of a technology to automate the development of physical database software.

#! We give an efficient procedure for verifying that a finite-state concurrent system meets a specification expressed in a (propositional, branching-time) temporal logic. Our algorithm has complexity linear in both the size of the specification and the size of the global state graph for the concurrent system. We also show how this approach can be adapted to handle fairness. We argue that our technique can provide a practical alternative to manual proof construction or use of a mechanical theorem prover for verifying many finite-state concurrent systems. Experimental results show that state machines with several hundred states can be checked in a matter of seconds.

#! Textnet is a new system for structuring text. The Textnet approach uses one uniform data structure to capture graphlike pools of text, as well as embedded hierarchical structures. By using a semantic network formalism of nodes connected by typed links, the relationships between neighboring pieces of text are made explicit. Also described is our partial implementation of the Textnet approach, which makes use of an object-oriented window/menu-driven user interface. Users peruse the network by moving among object menus or by reading text along a path through the network. In addition, critiquing, reader linking, searching, and jumping are easily accessible operations. Finally, the results of a short trial with users are presented.

#! The logical routing of a message in a computer mail system involves the identification and location of the set of intended recipients for that message. This function is carried out by the naming and addressing mechanism of the mail system. An important property of that mechanism is that it should be able to identify and locate all the intended recipients of a message, so that, once submitted, a message will not become lost or stuck in the system. We first discuss message addressing schemes, which are a framework for dealing with the naming and addressing problem. Message addressing schemes can also serve as a basis for the analysis of some of the properties of logical message routing within a system. We examine the conditions necessary for a complete message addressing scheme, that is, one that guarantees to deliver all possible messages.

#% 318453
#! The enduring dichotomy between spatial and symbolic modes of representation and retrieval acquires an added pragmatic dimension through recent developments in computer-based information retrieval. The standard name-based approach to object reference is now supplemented on some systems by a spatial alternative-often driven by an office or desktop metaphor. Little rigorous evidence is available, however, to support the supposition that spatial memory in itself is more effective than symbolic memory.The accuracy of spatial versus symbolic reference was assessed in three experiments. In Experiment 1 accuracy of location reference in a location-only filing condition was initially comparable to that in a name-only condition, but deteriorated much more rapidly with increases in the number of objects filed. In Experiment 2 subjects placed objects in a two-dimensional space containing landmarks (drawings of a desk, table, filing cabinets, etc.) designed to evoke an office metaphor, and in Experiment 3 subjects placed objects in an actual, three-dimensional mock office. Neither of these enhancements served to improve significantly the accuracy of location reference, and performance remained below that of a name-only condition in Experiment 1. The results raise questions about the utility of spatial metaphor over symbolic filing and highlight the need for continuing research in which considerations of technological and economic feasibility are balanced by considerations of psychological utility.

#! A robust storage structure is intended to provide the ability to detect and possibly correct damage to the structure. One possible source of damage is the partial completion of an update operation, due to a "crash" of the program or system performing the update. Since adding redundancy to a structure increases the number of fields which must be changed, it is not clear whether adding redundancy will help or hinder crash recovery. This paper examines some of the general principles of using robust storage structures for crash recovery. It also describes a particular class of linked list structures which can be made arbitrarily robust, and which are all suitable for crash recovery.

#! An important consideration in the design of high- performance multiple processor systems should be in ensuring the correctness of results computed by such complex systems which are extremely prone to transient and intermittent failures. The detection and location of faults and errors concurrently with normal system operation can be achieved through the application of appropriate on-line checks on the results of the computations. This is the domain of algorithm-based fault tolerance, which deals with low-cost system-level fault-tolerance techniques to produce reliable computations in multiple processor systems, by tailoring the fault-tolerance techniques toward specific algorithms. This paper presents a graph-theoretic model for determining upper and lower bounds on the number of checks needed for achieving concurrent fault detection and location. The objective is to estimate ate the overhead in time and the number of processors required for such a scheme. Faults in processors, errors in the data, and checks on the data to detect and locate errors are represented as a tripartite graph. Bounds on the time and processor overhead are obtained by considering a series of subproblems. First, using some crude concepts for t-fault detection and t-fault location, bounds on the maximum size of the error patterns that can arise from such fault patterns are obtained. Using these results, bounds are derived on the number of checks required for error detection and location. Some numerical results are derived from a linear programming formulation.

#! In this paper, we study fault-tolerant multiprocessor systems employing redundant-path multistage interconnection networks. Such systems permit interprocessor communication in the presence of faulty components in the network. The interconnection network considered is a delta network augmented with an extra switching stage in front. When the first and last stages are fault-free, the extra-stage delta networks continue to provide full access in the presence of all single and many multiple faults in switching elements of the intermediate stages. In this paper, we use graph-theoretic techniques to study the problem of routing permutations in extra-stage delta networks when faults are present in the network. We first formulate the problem of performing an arbitrary permutation on the fault-free network as a vertex-coloring problem and later extend this to networks with noncritical faults. Although the general problem of realizing a permutation in the minimum number of passes is intractable, classes of permutations with some regularity can be routed optimally. To illustrate the idea, we consider the class of BPC (bit permute-complement) permutations: algorithms for performing arbitrary permutations in this class on the extra-stage delta network are given, both for the fault-free network and for a network with noncritical faults.

#! A new test data reduction technique called accumulator compression testng (ACT) is proposed. ACT is an extension of syndrome testing. It is shown that the enumeration of errors missed by ACT for a unit under test is equivalent to the number of restricted partitions of a number. Asymptotic results are obtained for independent and dependent error modes. Comparison is made between signature analysis (SA) and ACT. Theoretical results indicate that with ACT a better control over fault coverage can be obtained than with SA. Experimental results are supportive of this indication. Built-in self test for processor environments may be feasible with ACT. However, for general VLSI circuits the complexity of ACT may be a problem as an adder is necessary.

#% 374261
#! We consider repairable computer systems, those for which repair can be performed to put the system back in operation. The behavior of the system is assumed to be modeled as a homogeneous Markov process. We calculate numerically the distribution of cumulative operational time, which is the distribution of the total time during which the system was in operation over a finite observation period. The method is based on the randomization technique. The main advantages include the ability to specify error tolerances in advance, numerical stability, and simplicity of implementation. We also show that other quantities of interest can be calculated as a byproduct of the method without any significant extra computational effort.

#! Provably conservative (and optimistic) reliability models can be systematically derived from more complex models. These derived models incorporate a reduced state space and fewer transitions, and, therefore, have solutions that are more cost- effective than those of the original complex models. The designer can extensively explore the design space without incurring the expense of solving multiple complex models. A conservative- optimistic pair of derived models produces a band that includes the solution to the complex model. Sensitivity analysis can be performed on this pair of models to determine those parameters of the original model that are most sensitive to change (i.e., uncertainty) and hence warrant further expense in obtaining tighter specifications.

It is shown that symbol-error correcting codes having additional bit-error correcting capabilities make additional memory protection by means of bit-error correcting codes superfluous and a newly designed symbol-and bit- error correcting code for the

#% 373779
#! A total of 840 junior and senior-level undergraduate business students particpated in three experiments that compared computer-generated graphical forms of data presentation to traditional tabular reports. The first experiment compared tables and bar charts for their effects on readability, interpretation accuracy, and decision making. No differences in interpretation accuracy or decision quality were observed for the two groups, although tabular reports were rated as "easier to read and understand" than graphical reports. The second experiment compared line plots to tables for their effects on interpretation accuracy and decision quality. Subjects with graphical reports outperformed those with tables. There were no meaningful differences in interpretation accuracy across treatment groups. The third experiment compared graphical and tabular reports for their ability to convey a "message" to the reader. Only in situations in which a vast amount of information was presented and relatively simple impressions were to be made, did subjects given graphs outperform those using tables.This program of cumulative experiments indicates that generalized claims of superiority of graphic presentation are unsupported, at least for decision-related activities. In fact, the experiments suggest that the effectiveness of the data display format is largely a function of the characteristics of the task at hand, and that impressions gleaned from "one shot" studies of the effectiveness of the use of graphs may be nothing more than situationally dependent artifacts.

#! Prior research has identified two psychological processes that appear to be used by programmers when they perform design and coding tasks: (a) taxonomizing—identifying the conditions that evoke particular actions; and (b) sequencing—converting the taxa into a linear sequence of program code. Three structured tools—structured English, decision tables, and decision trees—were investigated in a laboratory experiment to determine how they facilitated these two processes. When taxonomizing had to be undertaken, structured English outperformed decision tables, and decision trees outperformed structured English. When sequencing had to be undertaken, decision trees and structured English outperformed decision tables, but decision trees and structured English evoked the same level of performance.

#! This paper presents a systematic approach to matching categories of query language interfaces with the requirements of certain user types. The method is based on a trend model of query language development on the dimensions of functional capabilities and usability. From the trend model the following are derived: a classification scheme for query languages, a criterion hierarchy for query language evaluation, a comprehensive classification scheme of query language users and their requirements, and preliminary recommendations for allocating language classes to user types.The method integrates the results of existing human factors studies and provides a structured framework for future research in this area. Current and expected developments are exemplified by the description of "new generation" database query languages. In a practical query language selection problem, the results of this paper can be used for preselecting suitable query language types; the final selection decision will also depend on organization-specific factors, such as the available database management system, hardware and software strategies, and financial system costs.

This paper will discuss ways in which one tool, Entity Relationship (ER) models, can be used in teaching data analysis and design. The role of ER models in database design will be reviewed. ER models will be considered as a framework for also dealing with file design. An example of an ER model will be given with a description of how it might be used in discussing file design issues with students.

Have their opinions been altered by the technological and software trends? Do younger and older students have similar or markedly differing views and computer experiences. Can the needs of the students be met by such courses, or are the students actually more technologically literate than we believe? Noting the changes that have taken place over the last three or four years in the literacy course, the authors prepared a survey that was completed by all the students in two universities (317 students) during the first class of the fall 1985 semester. The results of that survey are the basis of this paper.

The paper covers some of the major MT R&D groups, the general techniques they employ(ed), and the roles they play(ed) in the development of the field. The conclusions concern the seeming permanence of the translation problem, and potential re-integration of MT with mainstream Computational Linguistics.

#! Which computer languages should we be teaching our students — and why? This paper examines the multitude of languages now available from three perspectives: classificatory, predictive, and pedagogical. It offers a “linguistic” analysis of computer languages in terms of their structure, their function, and their genealogy. Using these classifications, the paper then analyzes current and future trends for each language type. The classifications and predictions suggest a fundamental distinction between two sorts of languages: those appropriate for public computing (i.e. programming done by most professional computer scientists) and those appropriate for private computing (computing by individuals for their own purposes). The paper suggests that while would-be computer scientists need to learn public computing languages, private computing languages may be especially appropriate for non-professional computer users.

The Department of Computer Science at the University of Kansas has recently created a new environment in order to better teach such topics as problem solving, algorithmic design, elementary programming techniques, and elementary computer techniques. This paper will discuss the transition from a time-sharing environment to a modern microcomputer laboratory. It will also discuss the pedagogic techniques used in the new environment. It is hoped that others will benefit from our experiences.

The process manager supports concurrent processes and provides operations for their synchronization and communication.

#! A Modula-2-based project series is presented. This three-project sequence is suitable for an undergraduate course in operating systems or systems programming, and embodies the three important principles of concurrent programming, algorithm animation, and code modification. Heavy use is made of the Modula-2 module; much of the code in the projects is given away to the students, who must then adapt it for the purpose. The project series requires the animation of several sort algorithms, which are invoked as independent tasks under Modula-2 and display their state in different screen windows. These projects do not require special hardware and can be run using a “dumb terminal” 24 x 80 screen.

A later course makes use of VAX-11 MACRO assembly language on a VAX 11/780. This paper shows how the major constructs for structured programming may be implemented in VAX-11 MACRO. The scheme involves assembly language templates for each of the constructs, a standard labeling scheme, and a commenting method which reflects the structure of the program.

To support this contention four prototype courseware packages are used to briefly describe the Visible Algorithms project at Northridge. These packages provide tutorials on, and graphic animations of: linked list, binary tree, B-tree, and memory management algorithms.

#! This paper presents a learning-research based argument for the integration of computer programming into the science and mathematics curricula in pre-college education as well as college. Students who generate solutions to science and mathematics problems develop a procedural understanding of the fundamental theories of these disciplines. Students should be taught to use programming languages for these solutions for the same reasons they are taught the universal tools of arithmetic and algebra, and because only a computer provides the means to describe solutions in explicit, correct, and executable form. Programming should be integrated into all mathematics and science teaching from the earliest years. In precollege education, programming should be taught over a period of eight to ten years, rather than as a 6-12 week separate topic, and should be matched to the level of complexity of the science and mathematics content.

#! Immediately or soon after an introductory course in programming, traditional computer science education usually includes a course on data structures. Such courses, however, have suffered from a lack of non-textual materials for classroom and non-classroom use. Consequently, it is difficult for students to comprehend the abstractions involved in implementing and applying fundamental data structures without laboriously employing printed materials.The work discussed herein addresses the problem by developing software for the IBM PC that will allow data structure users to view graphically the effects of primitive operations and application programs on basic data structures. Several such structures and applications are examined and plans for a program interface are discussed.

Many students who are not computer majors will write programs as part of their jobs. Therefore, it is important to expose those students who will take only one or two programming courses to the idea of abstract data types.

#! The specification of a system is a major problem. One useful technique is to involve users in the design process. This requires considerable skill on the part of the software professionals. As one component of our software engineering course we are trying to develop this skill.We ask our students to design a system, and as a part of developing the system specification we give them an opportunity to interview a “user.” Since real users are often not very helpful, we deliberately arrange that our “users” will be obtuse regarding technical details of the system. We then conduct follow-up classroom discussion which, we hope, will leave the students with a much more realistic idea of what to expect from a user. A skillful interviewer can often gain valuable insights from users into which aspects of the system are most important to the specifications.

#! A scheme is presented for classifying recursive problems based upon an analysis of their parameters. Several well known recursive algorithms are then classified according to this scheme. The classification is used to determine if strategies for effecting significant savings in computation time of a recursive algorithm can be developed. Such strategies and the results of applying them are also discussed.

It is then proposed that a course in performance evaluation contain a component on the role of performance work in the product life cycle. A prototype model for this is described in detail. The description includes the need for such work, who accomplishes it, what sort of interactions are necessary and appropriate, and what steps comprise integrating performance work into a product life cycle.

#! This paper describes an original method for introducing linear recurrence relations. Boolean expressions are represented by binary trees and the counting of the internal nodes of these trees yield linear recurrence relations. The method allows the students to create their own family of Boolean expressions, to draw the corresponding binary trees, to deduce the recurrence relation representing the number of nodes in the trees, and finally, to solve and check the solutions of these relations.

#! The purpose of this paper is to describe a project in a course on Operating Systems. The project is designed to reinforce the concepts of memory management, process management and processor management that are discussed in most Operating Systems texts. Each student is to design and write a program that will simulate these major components of an operating system. This project is presented to the student in 3 phases and is written in Pascal although it can be adapted to other languages. The first phase requires the design of memory management routines for an operating system which schedules jobs through the use of a combined round robin/FIFO philosophy. The major concerns are the allocation and deallocation of memory pages as programs are submitted to the system and are removed from the system as they finish. The second phase takes into account various scheduling techniques, I/O requests, and swapping. Having already worked out the bugs in the memory management routines, the student now must be concerned with the management of the jobs that pass through the system. The third and last phase is the implementation of job synchronization. Several events are described, any of which may be the object of a WAIT or SIGNAL directive issued by an executing program. The project must synchronize jobs that issue a WAIT and SIGNAL directive on the same event.The project is part of a 3 credit course in Operating Systems taught to Juniors and Seniors. Successful completion of the project includes not only the correct implementation of a well documented and logically designed operating system, but also a comparative study, within each phase, of the efficiency and effectiveness of the operating system as a variety of parameters, which describe the environment, are changed. Observations are submitted in a report that is required with each phase.

#! Two new procedures for manipulating multiple stacks which share sequential memory locations are discussed. The first is the dynamic initial allocation procedure in which each stack is allocated as its first element arrives rather than having every stack preallocated at the very beginning of the entire process. The second is the local reallocation procedure; in this scheme, when a stack overflows, only its neighboring stacks, rather than the entire memory area, are reorganized provided that a certain condition is satisfied. The results of simulation appear to suggest that these new approaches improve the operational performance in many applications. With appropriate modifications, these concepts may also be applied to any other type of multiple linear lists (e.g., multiple queues) sharing sequential memory locations.

This note continues the application of the theory of strategic contingencies to the information services department by describing a study of intraorganizational power that uses basically the same procedures as the Lucas study and obtains similar results. In an effort to stimulate future power-related research in the information systems area, this note concludes by suggesting several reasons, beyond those given by Lucas, for the levels of power attributed to information services departments.

#! "User involvement" in information system development is generally considered an important mechanism for improving system quality and ensuring successful system implementation. The common assumption that user involvement leads to system usage and/or information satisfaction is examined in a survey of 200 production managers. Alternative models exploring the causal ordering of the three variables are developed and tested via path analysis. The results demonstrate that user involvement in the development of information systems will enhance both system usage and the user's satisfaction with the system. Further, the study provides evidence that the user's satisfaction with the system will lead to greater system usage.

It investigates how the usage patterns of the database, defined by the characteristics of information requests presented to it, affect its conceptual design. The construction of minimum-cost answers to information requests for a variety of query types and cost structures is also studied. The resulting costs of incomplete database information are balanced against the data-related costs in the derivation of the optimal design.

The scheme is based on a simple heuristic for self-organizing sequential search and on variable-length encodings of integers. We prove that it never performs much worse than Huffman coding and can perform substantially better; experiments on real files show that its performance is usually quite close to that of Huffman coding. Our scheme has many implementation advantages: it is simple, allows fast encoding and decoding, and requires only one pass over the data to be compressed (static Huffman coding takes two passes).

#! There are a number of techniques for representing pictorial information, among them are borders, arrays, and skeletons. Quadtrees are often used to store black and white picture information. A variety of techniques have been suggested for improving quadtrees, including linear quadtrees, QMATs (quadtree medial axis transform), forests of quadtrees, etc. The major purpose of these improvements is to reduce the storage required without greatly increasing the processing costs. All of these methods suffer from the fact that the structure of the underlying quadtree can be very sensitive to the placement of the origin.In this paper we discuss a translation invariant data structure (which we name TID) for storing and processing images based on the medial axis transform of the image that consists of all the maximal black squares contained in the image. We also discuss the performance of TID with other existing structures such as QMATs, forests of quadtrees, and normalized quadtrees. Some discussion on the union and intersection of images using TID is included.

The course is somewhat unique in that the students are divided into teams, all working on some aspect of the same problem. Thus, there is an emphasis on communication between teams, an emphasis on ensuring that the design of the various subteams interface, and an emphasis on learning to work as part of a group.The team concept described is an attempt to simulate an actual industrial or commercial environment within the structure and safety of the college classroom. To the students' surprise, the goal is not to implement a program (although we do that) but to illustrate the need for clear design techniques, the need for proper testing procedures and, above all, the need for precise communication.

To be a successful business data processing professional, one should possess effective written and oral communication skills; therefore, any program which prepares computing students for the business world should effectively train them in this area. Of the programs that attempt to handle this situation, most merely require their students to take several English/communication courses. From experience, this method is less effective than additionally reinforcing the students' communication skills within the entire range of the computing curriculum.

ASP, a subset of standard PASCAL, is used as the source language. The compiler for ASP is to be developed in various phases: character manipulator, lexical analyzer, syntax analyzer, semantic analyzer, and code generator. Recursive descent method is used to parse the various syntactic entities. The code generator emits code for a hypothetical machine called AOC (ALGOL Object Code). A simulator executes this code.

#! During the 1983-84 academic year, the University of Scranton instituted an experimental two semester discrete mathematics course for freshman students majoring in computer science. Approximately one-third of them were enrolled in this sequence while the remaining freshmen were enrolled in a traditional algebra-calculus mathematics sequence. At the end of the academic year the records of the freshman computer science majors were examined to see if there was any difference in performance between those who took discrete mathematics and those who did not.There is a strong indication that students who take discrete mathematics make higher grades in computer science than do the students who take the algebra-calculus sequence of courses. There is no indication that students who take discrete mathematics are more (or less) likely to change majors during the freshman year than those who take a traditional mathematics course.

#! This paper extends research on the use of the cloze test in the domain of computer software. In this study the cloze blanks were divided for the purposes of analysis into five structural subcategories. The relationships of the total cloze score and the subcategory scores to two criterion test measures were found to be positive, with the strongest and most consistent relationships being found for the variable subcategory. Use of the cloze test for both instructional and assessment purposes was discussed.

#! This study investigated the relationship between the student's grade in a beginning computer science course and their sex, age, high school and college academic performance, number of mathematics courses, and work experience. Standard measures of cognitive development, cognitive style, and personality factors were also given to 58 students in three sections of the beginning Pascal programming class.Significant relationships were found between the letter grade and the students' college grades, the number of hours worked and the number of high school mathematics classes. Both the Group Embedded Figures Test (GEFT) and the measure of Piagetian intellectual development stages were also significantly correlated with grade in the course. There was no relationship between grade and the personality type, as measured by the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI); however, an interesting and distinctive personality profile was evident.

#! Readability and comprehensibility are among the most important attributes of a program. A program that is easy to read and understand is easier to test, maintain, and modify. Many factors affect program readability and comprehensibility, including variable names, internal documentation, modularity, and so on. This paper investigates the influence of color on program readability and comprehension. Three color schemes were used: Color-scheme-A used different colors to indicate the different blocks in a program; Color-scheme-B used different colors to identify the various statements function in the program; and the third color scheme was the usual black-and-white programs. This study showed that subjects who used programs with Color-scheme-B had the highest mean score for program comprehension, followed by those who used Color-scheme-A. Subjects who used black-and-white programs scored the lowest on the comprehension quiz.

#! The author has been actively involved in the retraining of college faculty to teach computing science for six years. He is presently recruiting a fifth class for a two-summer masters degree program which addresses this goal, and is preparing for a seventh offering of a week-long, non-credit summer institute. This paper reflects upon the experience of having worked first-hand with nearly 200 faculty members from a great variety of disciplines. It also incorporates interchanges with directors of other formal retraining efforts around the country, and the comments made by some of the nearly 500 faculty who have participated in formal summer retraining programs. From these sources the author tries to clarify the phenomena of retraining and suggests some areas which merit further study.

#! This paper outlines a set of workshops to provide training for certified high school computer science teachers. Upon the completion of the four core workshops, a high school teacher would have an excellent background to teach high school computer science as detailed in the new proposed ACM Curriculum for high school certification. The workshops should also do a good job upgrading the background of high school computer science and computer math teachers to teach courses currently in the high school curriculum. One workshop, PASCAL with Applications to Data Structures, was specifically designed to prepare current high school teachers to teach a PASCAL course whose goal is to prepare students for the advanced placement test. Each of the six workshops is a three semester hour course and most carry graduate credit. Three of the six courses have already been offered and more should be taught next summer. The reception of the high school teachers to the workshops has been very enthusiastic.

This paper describes our experience in using Ada as a vehicle for teaching Software Engineering concepts in a course for first year undergraduate students at the University of Montreal.We first review the curriculum at our university and then give an idea of the hardware and software at our disposition. We describe the goals we had in mind in using Ada as a teaching language and then we detail the topics and the assignments chosen in our course. We conclude by describing a few lessons learned from that experience. All in all, we are very satisfied with this experiment and we intend to carry on next year.

#! An introductory computer science course is frequently the most difficult course in the curriculum to teach. Computer science educators must stay abreast of rapidly changing trends, text books, technology and teaching techniques. This paper provides an overview and perspective of introductory computer science courses, surveys some trends, and presents new alternative approaches regarding organization, foundations and material. It is based on the premise that the introductory course should create strong foundations upon which students can build, and that the curriculum should teach students to build software systems which people use and maintain, not just toy computer programs. The paper presents personal views and insights, motivates underlying concepts, and provides many useful suggestions which have been successfully employed in such introductory courses.

#! A heuristic is given for finding minimal perfect hash functions without extensive searching. The procedure is to construct a set of graph (or hypergraph) models for the dictionary, then choose one of the models for use in constructing the minimal perfect hashing function. The construction of this function relies on a backtracking algorithm for numbering the vertices of the graph. Careful selection of the graph model limits the time spent searching. Good results have been obtained for dictionaries of up to 181 words. Using the same techniques, non-minimal perfect has functions have been found for sets of up to 667 words.

#! The design and implementation of graphics packages has been widely studied and discussed. The special needs of the teaching environment change the requirements of a package in some interesting ways because the details usually hidden from the user are of interest to the students. Here the design of such a package is considered. In order to identify the needs of the package, the structures of CORE (which is used throughout as an example of an applications-oriented package) are compared with a list of topics covered in an elementary graphics course. Some of the nonessential flexibility of CORE can be thrown away, and procedures needed to handle hierarchy and manipulation of the structured display file can be added. A package (the Northwestern University Simple Graphics Package) resulting from this analysis is described. Specific suggestions are made for pruning CORE to a manageable size. A natural way of accessing the structured display files and a system of symbols are included. The resulting package is small, manageable and useful.During the summer of 1983 I was given the opportunity to teach the first computer graphics course to be offered at the University of Chicago. The only available software was PLOT-10 [11], in a version designed to interface to FORTRAN on the DEC-20. The only prerequisite for the course was an elementary programming course which taught PASCAL, hence the students could not be expected to program in FORTRAN. Some experimentation with the versions of FORTRAN, PASCAL, and PLOT-10 on the DEC-20 revealed that interfacing the PLOT-10 routines to PASCAL wasn't going to work. A second, more important, reason for rejecting this option was the lack of segmentation capability in PLOT-10. I was planning to use Principles of Interactive Computer Graphics by Foley and Van Dam [3] and I wanted the students to be able to program in the spirit of the ACM CORE [4] inspired Simple Graphics Package (SGP) used in the text. My solution was to implement this SGP in PASCAL on the DEC-20, with drivers for two of the terminal types available on campus. During the quarter I taught the course I realized that this was not an adequate solution. There were some things I just couldn't demonstrate for the students and some things that I couldn't put into the programming assignments.For example, a fair amount of time was spent discussing package implementation: clipping algorithms, coordinate transformations, the segment data (visibility, detectability), etc. It was impossible, in the UC SGP, to look at this information as an image was constructed and modified. It was equally impossible for the students to manipulate these constructs directly.I would have had similar problems with a full implementation of CORE and with any other package with which I am familiar. Basically, the packages designed for graphics applications hide the details of the implementation and present a high level view to the user. This is great when implementing an interactive graphics program but it is not so great when trying to teach how the packages work.This should not be taken as a blanket condemnation of the use of packages for computer graphics classes, nor as a suggestion that students should always be reduced to programming at the display processor level. There are good reasons for using packages, or at least package-like systems, in an elementary graphics course. Packages provide the user-friendly environment needed to start the students in computer graphics, and to allow the students to become familiar with graphics software as it exists in the real world. The students will learn the style and format of CORE, GKS [6, 12, 13, 14], PLOT-10, or whatever package is chosen. Last, but perhaps most important to a busy instructor (and is there any other kind?), using a package means writing a minimum of new software.Learning from the experience of writing and using the UC SGP, I modified the package to include some extra capabilities. At this time the package was also moved to a VAX 11/780 at Northwestern University. The design described in this paper includes slightly more than either of these packages. (Throughout the discussion the first package is called UC SGP and the second NU SGP.)The design and implementation of a graphics teaching system depends on the available tools. If there is already a sophisticated package, a little bit of extra software may suffice. I'm going to consider the situation in which a new package will be written expressly for use in teaching. Similar considerations are valid when extending an extant package. There are certain objectives to keep in mind. The package should be small so that it runs efficiently and so that it can be implemented with a reasonable effort. The features which will make it a good learning tool should be emphasized and those which further flexibility but not insight can be de-emphasized. The system should be designed to work with dumb terminals, if those are the ones likely to be available in sufficient quantity for student use. (If there are enough smart terminals the package can do a little more and may be easier to produce.) When designing a small system like this one, it is a good idea to keep the available hardware in mind, retaining sufficient flexibility to include other hardware later. (In the real world the flexibility of the package depends somewhat on the shortness of the time available for the implementation.)I'd like to start with the ACM CORE, a well documented and well known system, and sculpt it to the needs of teaching carving away some excess and adding some new capabilities.

#! The SIGGRAPH Education Committee has been considering recommendations for inclusion of graphics in various curricula for higher education. Several issues of computer graphics in computer science or computer science/engineering curricula are identified here. In particular the course content and support facilities necessary and the status of graphics courses within programs are discussed. A basic premise is stated that Curriculum '78[1] and other guidelines[2, 3, 4, 5, 6] for educational programs are flawed in their lack of computer graphics content. The reasons for this are not immediately apparent, but might in part be attributed to the lower profile of graphics during the time of their initial development. Since that time the significant technical advancements and standardization of terms and concepts have not been incorporated as changes in recommended curricula designs.

Spreadsheets are the subject of this report. The potential of spreadsheet systems for teaching assembler programming is considered. We outline a model for enabling students to acquire fundamental computer science concepts using a simplistic “language machine”. The language machine is embedded in a programmable spreadsheet package which acts as the host language. The aim of the project is to explore the possibility of creating interactive, robust and instructional computer models using some of the more powerful spreadsheet packages in an imaginative fashion.

#! Visual models help to convey programming insights and computer science principles. This paper describes the design criteria for a software system which automatically constructs visual models as a program runs. Line-by-line execution and data structures are dynamically updated on a display screen. The system can be used either by an instructor in class demonstrations, or by the student in running his or her own programs.Motivations for the design criteria are discussed, along with tradeoffs in implementation. A system has been developed for the Pascal programming language, running on a variety of popular microcomputers.

#! The ideal computer language is seen as one that would be as readable as natural language, and so adaptable that it could serve as the only language a user need ever know. An approach to language design has emerged that shows promise of allowing one to come much closer to that ideal than might reasonably have been expected. Using this approach, a language referred to as ML has been developed, and has been implemented as a language-creation system in which user-defined procedures invoked at translation time translate the source to some object code. In this way the user can define both the syntax and the semantics of the source language. Both language and implementation are capable of further development. This paper describes the approach, the language, and the implementation and recommends areas for further work.

#! File organizations based on conventional hash functions provide faster access to the stored records in comparison with tree-like file structures. Tree structures such as B+-trees and ISAM do provide for sequential processing, but require considerable storage for the indices. When sequential processing is needed a table that performs an order-preserving transformation on keys can be used. H is an order-preserving key transform if H(K1) &ges; H(K2), for all keys K1 K2. We present methodologies for constructing such key transforms, and illustrate them for some real-life key sets. Storage requirements for the table needed to carry out the transformation are less than those needed for the indices.

#! A record-based, algebraically-oriented model is introduced for describing data for “object histories” (with computation), such as checking accounts, credit card accounts, taxes, schedules, and so on. The model consists of sequences of computation tuples defined by a computation-tuple sequence scheme (CSS). The CSS has three major features (in addition to input data): computation (involving previous computation tuples), “uniform” constraints (whose satisfaction by a computation-tuple sequence u implies satisfaction by every interval of u), and specific sequences with which to start the valid computation-tuple sequences. A special type of CSS, called “local,” is singled out for its relative simplicity in maintaining the validity of a computation-tuple sequence. A necessary and sufficient condition for a CSS to be equivalent to at least one local CSS is given. Finally, the notion of “local bisimulatability” is introduced for regarding two CSS as conveying the same information, and two results on local bisimulatability in connection with local CSS are established.

#! The concept of a tuple sequence is introduced in order to investigate structure connected with relational model implementation. Analogs are presented for the relational operations of projection, join, and selection, and the decomposition problem for tuple sequences is considered. The lexicographical ordering of tuple sequences is studied via the notion of (lexicographic) index. A sound and complete set of inference rules for indexes is exhibited, and two algorithmic questions related to indexes examined. Finally, indexes and functional dependencies in combination are studied.

#! The desirability of acyclic (conflict-free) schemes is well argued in [8] and [13]. When a scheme is described by multivalued dependencies, acyclicity means that the dependencies do not split each other's left-hand side and do not form intersection anomalies. It is shown that if the second condition fails to hold, the scheme can be amended so that it does hold. The basic step is to add one attribute and some dependencies to resolve one intersection anomaly. This step generates an extension of the given scheme in which the anomaly does not exist. Also, the iterative use of the basic step is analyzed and it is proved that the transformation so defined terminates and removes all intersection anomalies.

#! The basic inference problem is defined as follows: For a finite set X = {xi, 聟 , xn}, we wish to infer properties of elements of X on the basis of sets of "queries" regarding subsets of X. By restricting these queries to statistical queries, the statistical database (SDB) security problem is obtained. The security problem for the SDB is to limit the use of the SDB so that only statistical information is available and no sequence of queries is sufficient to infer protected information about any individual. When such information is obtained the SDB is said to be compromised. In this paper, two applications concerning the security of the SDB are considered: On-line application. The queries are answered one by one in sequence and it is necessary to determine whether the SDB is compromised if a new query is answered. Off-line application. All queries are available at the same time and it is necessary to determine the maximum subset of queries to be answered without compromising the SDB. The complexity of these two applications, when the set of queries consists of (a) a single type of SUM query, (b) a single type of MAX/MIN query, (c) mixed types of MAX and MIN queries, (d) mixed types of SUM and MAX/MIN queries, and (e) mixed types of SUM, MAX, and MIN queries, is studied. Efficient algorithms are designed for some of these situations while others are shown to be NP-hard.

#! The notion of sort set is introduced here to formalize the fact that certain database relations can be sorted so that two or more columns are simultaneously listed in order. This notion is shown to be applicable in several ways to enhance the efficiency of an implemented database. A characterization of when order dependency implies the existence of sort sets in a database is presented, along with several corollaries concerning complexity, Armstrong relations, and cliques of certain graphs. Sort-set dependencies are then introduced. A (finite) sound and complete set of inference rules for sort-set dependencies is presented, as well as a proof that there is no such set for functional and sort-set dependencies taken together. Deciding logical implication for sort-set dependencies is proved to be polynomial, but if functional dependencies are included the problem is co-NP-complete.

A natural generalization of Armstrong relation, here called separator, is given and then used to study the relationship between order and sort-set dependencies.

Finally, it is proved that Sn/log n → c* = 0.3733 … , in probability, where c* is defined by c log((2e)/c) = 1, c ≤ 1, and Sn is the saturation level of the same tree, that is, the number of full levels in the tree.

#! This paper considers a variant of the Byzantine Generals problem, in which processes start with arbitrary real values rather than Boolean values or values from some bounded range, and in which approximate, rather than exact, agreement is the desired goal. Algorithms are presented to reach approximate agreement in asynchronous, as well as synchronous systems. The asynchronous agreement algorithm is an interesting contrast to a result of Fischer et al, who show that exact agreement with guaranteed termination is not attainable in an asynchronous system with as few as one faulty process. The algorithms work by successive approximation, with a provable convergence rate that depends on the ratio between the number of faulty processes and the total number of processes. Lower bounds on the convergence rate for algorithms of this form are proved, and the algorithms presented are shown to be optimal.

#! In solving large sparse linear least squares problems A x &sime; b, several different numeric methods involve computing the same upper triangular factor R of A. It is of interest to be able to compute the nonzero structure of R, given only the structure of A. The solution to this problem comes from the theory of matchings in bipartite graphs. The structure of A is modeled with a bipartite graph, and it is shown how the rows and columns of A can be rearranged into a structure from which the structure of its upper triangular factor can be correctly computed. Also, a new method for solving sparse least squares problems, called block back-substitution, is presented. This method assures that no unnecessary space is allocated for fill, and that no unnecessary space is needed for intermediate fill.

In this paper a powerful, and yet simple, technique for devising approximation algorithms for a wide variety of NP-complete problems in routing, location, and communication network design is investigated. Each of the algorithms presented here delivers an approximate solution guaranteed to be within a constant factor of the optimal solution. In addition, for several of these problems we can show that unless P = NP, there does not exist a polynomial-time algorithm that has a better performance guarantee.

#! Currently, network codes based on the primal simplex algorithm are believed to be computationally superior to those based on other methods. Some modifications of the out-of-kilter algorithm of Ford and Fulkerson are given, together with proofs of their correctness and computer implementations using appropriate data structures. The computational tests in this paper indicate that the final code based on these modifications is superior to any previously implemented version of this algorithm. Although this code is not competitive with state-of-the-art primal simplex codes, its performance is encouraging, especially in the case of assignment problems.

#! A method is presented for calculating the partition function, and from it, performance measures, for closed Markovian stochastic networks with queuing centers in which the service or processing rate depends on the center's state or load. The analysis on which this method is based is new and a major extension of our earlier work on load-independent queuing networks. The method gives asymptotic expansions for the partition function in powers of 1/N, where N is a parameter that reflects the size of the network. The expansions are particularly useful for large networks with many classes, each class having many customers. The end result is a decomposition by which expansion coefficients are obtained exactly by linear combinations of partition function values of small network constructs called pseudonetworks. Effectively computable bounds are given for errors arising from the use of a finite number of expansion terms. This method is important because load dependence is at once an essential element of sophisticated network models of computers, computer communications, and switching, teletraffic, and manufacturing systems, and the cause of very intensive computations in conventional techniques. With this method, very large load-dependent networks can be analyzed, whereas previously only small networks were computationally tractable.

#! A queuing system with infinitely many servers, and with the following queuing discipline is considered: For any two jobs i and j in the system, such that i arrived later than j, there is a fixed probability p that i will have to wait for j's execution to terminate before i starts executing. This queuing system is a very simple model for database concurrency control via “static” locking, as well as of parallel execution of programs consisting of several interdependent processes. The problem of determining the maximum arrival rate (as a function of p) that can be sustained before this system becomes unstable is studied. It is shown that this rate is inversely proportional to p, and close upper and lower bounds on the constant for the case of deterministic departures are found. The result suggests that the degree of multiprogramming of multiuser databases, or the level of parallelism of concurrent programs, is inversely proportional to the probability of conflict, and that the constant is small and known within a factor of 2. The technique used involves the computation of certain asymptotic parameters of a random infinite directed acyclic graph (dag) that seem of interest by themselves.

#! Questions about the polynomial-time hierarchy are studied. In particular, the questions, “Does the polynomial-time hierarchy collapse?” and “Is the union of the hierarchy equal to PSPACE?” are considered, along with others comparing the union of the hierarchy with certain probabilistic classes. In each case it is shown that the answer is “yes” if and only if for every sparse set S, the answer is “yes” when the classes are relativized to S if and only if there exists a sparse set S such that the answer is “yes” when the classes are relativized to S. Thus, in each case the question is answered if it is answered for any arbitrary sparse oracle set.Long and Selman first proved that the polynomial-time hierarchy collapses if and only if for every sparse set S, the hierarchy relative to S collapses. This result is re-proved here by a different technique.

In contrast to their results, we prove that P = NP if and only if for every tally language T, P(T) = NP( T), and that NP = co-NP if and only if for every tally language T, NP(T) = co-NP(T). We show that the polynomial hierarchy collapses if and only if there is a sparse set S such that the polynomial hierarchy relative to S collapses. Similar results are obtained for several other complexity classes.

#! A supercompiler is a program transformer of a certain type. It traces the possible generalized histories of computation by the original program, and compiles an equivalent program, reducing in the process the redundancy that could be present in the original program. The nature of the redundancy that can be eliminated by supercompilation may be various, e.g., some variables might have predefined values (as in partial evaluation), or the structure of control transfer could be made more efficient (as in lazy evaluation), or it could simply be the fact that the same variable is used more than once. The general principles of supercompilation are described and compared with the usual approach to program transformation as a stepwise application of a number of equivalence rules. It is argued that the language Refal serves the needs of supercompilation best. Refal is formally defined and compared with Prolog and other languages. Examples are given of the operation of a Refal supercompiler implemented at CCNY on an IBM/370.

We begin development of concurrent programs by ignoring issues dealing with concurrency and introduce such concerns in manageable doses. The class of problems solved includes termination and deadlock detection.

#! With current compiler technology, changing a single line in a large software system may trigger massive recompilations. If the change occurs in a file with shared declarations, all compilation units depending upon that file must be recompiled to assure consistency. However, many of those recompilations may be redundant, because the change may affect only a small fraction of the overall system.Smart recompilation is a method for reducing the set of modules that must be recompiled after a change. The method determines whether recompilation is necessary by isolating the differences among program modules and analyzing the effect of changes. The method is applicable to languages with and without overloading. A prototype demonstrates that the method is efficient and can be added with modest effort to existing compilers.

These methods are now generalized for systems with an arbitrary integer coefficient matrix A. To make congruence techniques applicable, a common denominator of all elements of the solution X = A+B must be computed. This is achieved by defining the natural denominator CODE of A+ and describing it by some formulas. Methods for the exact computation of additional results (consistency, null space, solution of at most R nonzero elements), a recursive test to save computing time, and a comparison with some results from the literature are presented.

#! Popular codes for the numerical solution of nonstiff ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are based on a (fixed order) Runge-Kutta method, a variable order Adams method, or an extrapolation method. Extrapolation can be viewed as a variable order Runge-Kutta method. It is plausible that variation of order could lead to a much more efficient Runge-Kutta code, but numerical comparisons have been contradictory.We reconcile previous comparisons by exposing differences in testing methodology and incompatibilities of the implementations tested. An experimental Runge-Kutta code is compared to a state-of-the-art extrapolation code. With some qualifications, the extrapolation code shows no advantage. Extrapolation does not appear to be a particularly effective way to vary the order of Runge-Kutta methods. Although an acceptable way to solve nonstiff problems, our tests raise the question as to whether there is any point in pursuing it as a separate method.

#* Dynamic stereo: passive ranging to moving objects from relative image flows
#@ Allen M. Waxman;Sarvajit S. Sinha
#t 1986
#c IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence
#! A new concept in passive ranging to moving objects is described which is based on the comparison of multiple image flows. It is well known that if a static scene is viewed by an observer undergoing a known relative translation through space, then the distance to objects in the scene can be easily obtained from the measured image velocities associated with features on the objects (i.e., motion stereo). But in general, individual objects are translating and rotating at unknown rates with respect to a moving observer whose own motion may not be accurately monitored. The net effect is a complicated image flow field in which absolute range information is lost. However, if a second image flow field is produced by a camera whose motion through space differs from that of the first camera by a known amount, the range information can be recovered by subtracting the first image flow from the second. This ``difference flow'' must then be corrected for the known relative rotation between the two cameras, resulting in a divergent relative flow from a known focus of expansion. This passive ranging process may be termed Dynamic Stereo, the known difference in camera motions playing the role of the stereo baseline. We present the basic theory of this ranging process, along with some examples for simulated scenes.

#* Regularization of inverse visual problems involving discontinuities
#@ Demetri Terzopoulos
#t 1986
#c IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence
#! Inverse problems, such as the reconstruction problems that arise in early vision, tend to be mathematically ill-posed. Through regularization, they may be reformulated as well-posed variational principles whose solutions are computable. Standard regularization theory employs quadratic stabilizing functionals that impose global smoothness constraints on possible solutions. Discontinuities present serious difficulties to standard regularization, however, since their reconstruction requires a precise spatial control over the smoothing properties of stabilizers. This paper proposes a general class of controlled-continuity stabilizers which provide the necessary control over smoothness. These nonquadratic stabilizing functionals comprise multiple generalized spline kernels combined with (noncontinuous) continuity control functions. In the context of computational vision, they may be thought of as controlled-continuity constraints. These generic constraints are applicable to visual reconstruction problems that involve both continuous regions and discontinuities, for which global smoothness constraints fail.

#@ J. Brian Burns;Allen R. Hanson;Edward M. Riseman

#c IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence
#! This paper presents a new approach to the extraction of straight lines in intensity images. Pixels are grouped into line-support regions of similar gradient orientation, and then the structure of the associated intensity surface is used to determine the location and properties of the edge. The resulting regions and extracted edge parameters form a low-level representation of the intensity variations in the image that can be used for a variety of purposes. The algorithm appears to be more effective than previous techniques for two key reasons: 1) the gradient orientation (rather than gradient magnitude) is used as the initial organizing criterion prior to the extraction of straight lines, and 2) the global context of the intensity variations associated with a straight line is determined prior to any local decisions about participating edge elements.

This restriction enables one to compute the spatial orientation of a given corner and its motion from its image in terms of polar coordinates, Eulerian angles, and quaternions. One can also interpret the shape and the face adjacency from local information only. The necessary constraints are listed, and some examples are given to compare the presented scheme to existing ones. The possible nonuniqueness of the interpretation is also discussed.

It is sufficiently expressive to describe both the desired behavior of systems, their specifications, and their actual implementations in terms of simpler components. We say I satisfies S if 1 is a correct implementation of the specification S. We briefly discuss a semantic treatment of this notion of satisfaction, but the main emphasis of the paper is on a proof technique for proving statements of the form I satisfies S, based on syntactic transformations and induction. Two examples are given, both systolic systems from the literature.

#! The problem of correctness of the solutions to the distributed termination problem of Francez [7] is addressed. Correctness criteria are formalized in the customary framework for program correctness. A very simple proof method is proposed and applied to show correctness of a solution to the problem. It allows us to reason about liveness properties of temporal logic (see, e.g., Manna and Pnueli [12]) using a new notion of weak total correctness.

#* Creating raster Omnimax images from multiple perspective views using the elliptical weighted average filter
#@ Ned Greene;Paul S. Heckbert
#t 1986
#c IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications
#! Creation of Omnimax animation by computer opens up fantastic new visual possibilities. Unfortunately, the fish-eye distortion of Omnimax film images complicates synthesis by computer, since most image-synthesis programs can create only perspective views. As an alternative to modifying existing image-synthesis programs to produce Omnimax projections directly, we present a method for creating them from multiple perspective views. Four perspective views of the environment are created, each a projection onto a face of a cube centered at the camera, and then a mapping program creates an Omnimax projection from them. To minimize aliasing during resampling, the mapping program uses the elliptical weighted average filter, a space-variant filter we developed for this application that computes a weighted average over an arbitrarily oriented elliptical area. This filter can also be used for texture mapping 3D surfaces.

#! Computation of the union, intersection, and difference of n-dimensional objects plays a central role in several computer-aided geometric design problems. An algorithm for computing these operations that uses a boundary classification technique is presented here. The algorithm is recursive in structure, with the recursion being on the dimensions of objects dealt with at each stage. The representation treats all entities as objects, making no distinction between faces, edges, or vertices. The objects produced are "regularized"; that is, there are no degenerate boundaries such as dangling edges. The sample application given involves hidden-surface removal.

The Color Naming system allows users to specify color in natural lanuage phrases or words and is a siperior way for humans to select colors. the problems addressed in this article is how to map the linguistic values of the CNS to the numerical values of the HLS system so that the CNS can be part of an integrated graphics system. The algorithm used is based on fuzzy set theory and is implemented for the Tektronix 4027 color display terminal.

The alpha bitmap makes it possible to have black-and-white images that are nonrectangular or that have holes in them. It also provides a richer set of operations for working with bitmaps. We present the mathematics for a two-bit compositing algebra, and suggest extensions for two-bit compositing, painting, and region filling. Each of these operations can be implemented with ordinary bitblts and presented on ordinary bitmap displays. We analyze the cost of each two-bit operation in terms of the number of bitblts it requires.

This tutorial examines resultants, curve implicitization, curve inversion, and curve intersection. Discussion follows a series of examples simple enough for those with only a modest algebra background to follow.

#! Our objective is to understand the notion of type in programming languages, present a model of typed, polymorphic programming languages that reflects recent research in type theory, and examine the relevance of recent research to the design of practical programming languages.Object-oriented languages provide both a framework and a motivation for exploring the interaction among the concepts of type, data abstraction, and polymorphism, since they extend the notion of type to data abstraction and since type inheritance is an important form of polymorphism. We develop a &lgr;-calculus-based model for type systems that allows us to explore these interactions in a simple setting, unencumbered by complexities of production programming languages.The evolution of languages from untyped universes to monomorphic and then polymorphic type systems is reviewed. Mechanisms for polymorphism such as overloading, coercion, subtyping, and parameterization are examined. A unifying framework for polymorphic type systems is developed in terms of the typed &lgr;-calculus augmented to include binding of types by quantification as well as binding of values by abstraction.The typed &lgr;-calculus is augmented by universal quantification to model generic functions with type parameters, existential quantification and packaging (information hiding) to model abstract data types, and bounded quantification to model subtypes and type inheritance. In this way we obtain a simple and precise characterization of a powerful type system that includes abstract data types, parametric polymorphism, and multiple inheritance in a single consistent framework. The mechanisms for type checking for the augmented &lgr;-calculus are discussed.The augmented typed &lgr;-calculus is used as a programming language for a variety of illustrative examples. We christen this language Fun because fun instead of &lgr; is the functional abstraction keyword and because it is pleasant to deal with.Fun is mathematically simple and can serve as a basis for the design and implementation of real programming languages with type facilities that are more powerful and expressive than those of existing programming languages. In particular, it provides a basis for the design of strongly typed object-oriented languages.

There are notes throughout on 4.3BSD, the forthcoming system from the University of California at Berkeley. We trace the historical development of the UNIX system from its conception in 1969 until today, and describe the design principles that have guided this development. We then present the internal data structures and algorithms used by the kernel to support the user interface. In particular, we describe process management, memory management, the file system, the I/O system, and communications. These are treated in as much detail as the UNIX licenses will allow. We conclude with a brief description of the user interface and a set of bibliographic notes.

#! Data-flow languages have been hailed as the solution to the programmability of general-purpose multiprocessors. However, data-flow semantics introduce constructs that lead to much overhead at compilation, allocation, and execution time. Indeed, due to its functionality, the data-flow model of computation does not handle repetitive program constructs very efficiently. This is due to the fact that the cornerstone of data flow, namely the concept of single assignment, is opposed to the idea of reexecution of a portion of program as in a loop. A corollary of this problem is the effective representation, storage, and processing of data structures, as these will most often be used in loops. In this paper, various aspects of this issue are explailned in detail. Several solutions that have been put forward in the current literature are then surveyed and analyzed. In order to offset some of the disadvantages presented by these, we introduce new methods for handling arrays. In the first one, we raise the level of computation to that of arrays for more efficient operation. In the two others, the opposite approach is taken, and the notion of array is done away with entirely at the execution level in order to take advantage of the data-flow semantics at their best logical level of performance.

#! In this paper, a new approach to identifying faulty units in ti-diagnosable systems is described. This approach exploits special properties of the highly structured ti-diagnosable systems to produce a faulty unit identification algorithm which is shown to be of time complexity O(|E|) where |E| corresponds to the number of tests in the system. The diagnosis quality of the algorithm is as follows: 1) if the algorithm identifies a unit as faulty, it is always correct; 2) if the collection of test outcomes takes on a form that is compatible with a permanent fault situation, the algorithm identifies all of the corresponding faulty units; and 3) the algorithm identifies at least one faulty unit over collections of test outcomes significantly larger than those that are compatible with permanent fault situations.

#! This paper proposes and validates a methodology to measure explicitly the increase in the risk of a processor error with increasing workload. By relating the occurrence of a CPU related error to the system activity just prior to the occurrence of an error, the approach measures the dynamic CPU workload/failure relationship. The measurements show that the probability of a CPU related error (the load hazard) increases nonlinearly with increasing workload; i.e., the CPU rapidly deteriorates as end points are reached. The load hazard is observed to be most sensitive to system CPU utilization, the I/O rate, and the interrupt rates. The results are significant because they indicate that it may not be useful to push a system close to its performance limits (the previously accepted operating goal) since what we gain in slightly improved performance is more than offset by the degradation in reliability. Importantly, they also indicate that conventional reliability models need to be reevaluated so as to take system work-load explicity into account.

#! Previous models of program speedup on parallel architectures tend to ignore I/O activity and other important issues. In this paper we derive analytic speedup models including I/O activities. We show that ignoring I/O yields conservative speedup results. We explore the effectiveness of using hardware format conversion units in multiprocessors [33]. We prove that hardware parallel format conversion loses its edge over software parallel format conversion if the ratio of the number of processors to I/O bandwidth increases. For a given number of processors, program speedup is more sensitive to the available I/O bandwidth rather than the format conversion speed. Ninety-one Fortran programs are used in various experiments to verify our models and conclusions. Most of the programs are I/O bound. Our empirical results show that including I/O activity improves the speedup factor for 78 percent of the programs, and 18 percent of the programs are sped up only due to faster I/O activities. For a serial machine, using hardware format conversion units designed in [13] reduces program execution time by an average factor of three. The software format conversion speed used is obtained from direct measurements on an IBM 4341 running CMS and a CDC Cyber 175 running NOS. For multiprocessor systems a factor of eight increase in the processors to I/O bandwidth ratio reduces the effectiveness of hardware format conversion to an average factor of 1.36.

We give several examples to illustrate the utility of the design tool. In particular, we show how systolic designs for such problems as integer bitwise multiplication, dynamic programming, and language recognition can easily be derived using the characterizations. We also present some new results concerning the properties and computational power of systolic arrays which can be obtained using the characterizations.

Our algorithm generates a solution with an area 驴1.69* OPT where OPT is the area of an optimal solution. Our algorithm routes some of the nets by a simple greedy strategy. The remaining nets are routed using several strategies and four layouts are obtained. The best of these layouts is the solution generated by our algorithm.

#! When we design networks with NOR or NAND gates which are implemented with bipolar and MOS transistors, wired logic is usually allowed. The usage of wired logic reduces the network cost and possibly improves the speed because of shorter delays on wired logic than on a gate. Typical logic functions performed by wired logic are AND and OR, which are called wired-AND and wired-OR, respectively. Properties of networks with NOR gates and wired-AND (or wired-OR) are discussed. Some of these properties are used in developing synthesis procedures of optimum networks by the integer programming logic design method. For all three-variable functions, the optimum networks with NOR gates and wired-OR's, designed by this synthesis approach, are shown.

#! In order to be able to take full advantage of a distributed computing facility it is important not only to distribute the hardware but also to distribute the control of these resources. However, distributed control is very different from centralized control since at any time, several processes or several controllers may observe different and inconsistent views of the global system state. The task of scheduling jobs in a distributed system must also be done Without full knowledge of the system state. In this correspondence we define a totally new distributed scheduling algorithm LP (linear predictive). scheduling, which not only implements distributed control of task scheduling but is also able to adapt itself to workload fluctuations. Using a general-purpose distributed system simulator we have shown the performance rnitince advantages of this new algorithm.

#! A general technique that can be used to solve a wide variety of discrete optimization problems is the branch-and-bound algorithm. We have adapted and extended branch-and-bound algorithms for parallel processing. The computational efficiency of these algorithms depends on the allowance function, the data structure, and the search strategies. Anomalies owing to parallelism may occur. In this correspondence, anomalies of parallel branch-and-bound algorithms using the same search strategy as the corresponding serial algorithms are studied. Sufficient conditions to guarantee no degradation in performance due to parallelism and necessary conditions for allowing parallelism to have a speedup greater than the number of processors are presented.

#! The throughput of unbuffered shuffle-exchange networks (also known as delta networks) is related to the arrival rate by a quadratic recurrence relation. Lower and upper bounds on the solution of this recurrence relation are derived in this paper. Two approaches for improving the throughput of unbuffered delta networks are investigated. The first approach combines multiple delta subnetworks of size N x N each, in parallel, to obtain a network of size N x N. Three policies used to distribute the incoming packets between the subnetworks are discussed and the relative effect of each on the throughput is compared. The second approach replaces each link of the simple delta networks by K parallel links (K equals 2,4,...,). The throughput of such networks is analyzed and one possible implementation for crossbar switches that could be used in these networks is discussed. The throughput of such networks with four parallel links is almost equal to the throughput of crossbars.

#! A new multistage interconnection network is presented in this paper. It is able to handle the communications between the connected devices correctly, even in the presence of fault(s) in the network. This goal is achieved by using redundant paths with a fast procedure able to dynamically reroute the message. It is also shown that the rerouting properties are still valid when broadcasting transmission is used.

#! Distributed operating systems have many aspects in common with centralized ones, but they also differ in certain ways. This paper is intended as an introduction to distributed operating systems, and especially to current university research about them. After a discussion of what constitutes a distributed operating system and how it is distinguished from a computer network, various key design issues are discussed. Then several examples of current research projects are examined in some detail, namely, the Cambridge Distributed Computing System, Amoeba, V, and Eden.

#! Design of distributed computer systems is a complex task requiring solutions for several difficult problems. Location of computing resources and databases in a wide-area network is one of these problems which has not yet been solved satisfactorily. Solution of this problem involves determining number and size of computer facilities and their locations, configuring databases and allocating these databases among computer facilities. An integer programming formulation of the problem is presented. Heuristic and optimal solution procedures are developed and computational experience with these procedures is reported. Implications of the model for designing distributed systems are discussed.

#! In this paper, we present a new model, finite permutation machine (FPM), to describe the permutation networks. A set of theorems are developed to capture the theory of operations for the permutation networks. Using this new framework, an interesting problem is attacked: are 2n - 1 passes of shuffle exchange necessary and sufficient to realize all permutations? where n = log2 N and N is the number of inputs and outputs interconnected by the network. We prove that to realize all permutations, 2n - 1 passes of shuffle exchange are necessary and that 3n - 3 passes are sufficient. This reduces the sufficient number of passes by 2 from the best-known result.

#! A new class of switch-level logic circuits intended for modeling digital MOS VLSI circuits is presented. These circuits, which are called pseudo-Boolean, are composed of a single (voltage) source, connectors, switches, attenuators, and wells. The latter two devices are digital versions of resistors and capacitors, respectively, and may assume an arbitrary but finite number of different sizes. Signals are bidirectional, and are assigned a finite set of values of the form (v, s) where v corresponds to voltage level and s corresponds to electrical current or charge level (logical strength). It is shown that these signal values and the associated logical operations form a generalization of Boolean algebra called pseudo-Boolean or Heyting algebra. The analysis of pseudo- Boolean circuits using discrete counterparts of Kirchoff's current law and the superposition principle is discussed, as well as the application of pseudo-Boolean techniques to digital simulation.

#! One of the significant differences between the CRAY X-MP and its predecessor, the CRAY-1S, is a considerably increased memory bandwidth for vector operations. Up to three vector streams in each of the two processors may be active simultaneously. These streams contend for memory banks as well as data paths. All memory conflicts are resolved dynamically by the memory system. This paper describes a simulation study of the CRAY X-MP interleaved memory system with attention focused on steady state performance for sequences of vector operations. Because it is more amenable to analysis, we first study the interaction of vector streams issued from a single processor. We identify the occurrence of linked conflicts, repeating sequences of conflicts between two or more vector streams that result in reduced steady state performance. Both worst case and average case performance measures are given. The discussion then turns to dual processor interactions. Finally, based on our simulations, possible modifications to the CRAY X-MP memory system are proposed and compared. These modifications are intended to eliminate or reduce the effects of linked conflicts.

#! A well-known technique for providing tolerance against single hardware component failures is triplication of the component, called triple modular redundancy (TMR). In this paper a component is taken to be a processor-memory configuration where the memory is organized in a bit-sliced way. If voting is performed bitwise in an orthodox TMR configuration consisting of three of these components, failure of a complete component or failure of bit-slices not on corresponding positions in the memories can be tolerated. We present a TMR technique, not using more redundancy than orthodox TMR, that can tolerate the failure of arbitrary bit-slices (including those on corresponding positions) up to a certain amount. Additionally it can tolerate the failure of arbitrary bit-slices up to a certain amount whenever one component is known to be malfunctioning or whenever one component is disabled. This generalized TMR technique is described for processor-memory configurations processing 4-, 8-, and 16-bit words, respectively.

#! A low-level parallel processor (LLPP) is one in which two or more machine-level operations are executed in parallel. This paper analyzes the use of linearly connected LLPP's for parallel evaluation of program fragments. A graph-theoretic model is presented which describes the communication constraints of linearly connected parallel processors. A tight, necessary condition for finding assignments of program fragments to linearly connected LLPP's that require no communication delays is presented. Also, several weak sufficient conditions have been found and efficient heuristics for determining optimal assignments have been developed.

Such a system is said to be t1/t1-diagnosable [3] if, given any complete collection of test results, the set of faulty units can be isolated to within a set of at most t1 units. This paper exposes some new, important properties of general t1/t1-diagnosable systems to present an O(n2.5) algorithm by which all the faulty units except at most one can be correctly identified and all the faulty units can be isolated to within a set of t1 or fewer units in which at most one can possibly be fault free.

However, it is shown in this paper that redundancy and masking techniques are ineffective against synchronization failures which arise because of metastable behavior of synchronizing elements.

#! Performing permutations of data on SIMD computers efficiently is important for high-speed execution of parallel algorithms. In this correspondence we consider realizing permutations such as perfect shuffle, matrix transpose, bit-reversal, the class of bit-permute- complement (BPC), the class of Omega, and inverse Omega permutations on N = 2n processors with Illiac IV-type interconnection network, where each processor is connected to processors at distances of ± 1 and ± N. The minimum number of data transfer operations required for realizing any of these permutations on such a network is shown to be 2(N − 1). We provide a general three-phase strategy for realizing permutations and derive routing algorithms for performing perfect shuffle, Omega, Inverse Omega, bit reversal, and matrix-transpose permutations in 2(N − 1) steps. Our approach is quite simple, and unlike previous approaches, makes efficient use of the topology of the Illiac IV-type network to realize these permutations using the optimum number of data transfers. Our strategy is quite powerful: any permutation can be realized using this strategy in 3(N − 1) steps.

#! Alpine is a file system that supports atomic transactions and is designed to operate as a service on a computer network. Alpine's primary purpose is to store files that represent databases. An important secondary goal is to store ordinary files representing documents, program modules, and the like.Unlike other file servers described in the literature, Alpine uses a log-based technique to implement atomic file update. Another unusual aspect of Alpine is that it performs all communication via a general-purpose remote procedure call facility. Both of these decisions have worked out well. This paper describes Alpine's design and implementation, and evaluates the system in light of our experience to date.Alpine is written in Cedar, a strongly typed modular programming language that includes garbage-collected storage. We report on using the Cedar language and programming environment to develop Alpine.

#! Superimposition of two image data sets allows the spatial distribution of one to be directly related to that of the other. If the two data sets have different spatial structures, the composite image is generally confusing and difficult to interpret. A method of representing image data sets in the form of naturally occurring variables in a realistic apparently three-dimensional scene is presented. One data set is represented by the topography of a surface, depicted by shaded-relief methods, while another is represented by the color of the surface, or by the color of an overlaid transparency. Presentation in this form exploits the normal scene decomposition abilities of the human visual system, allowing intuitive appreciation and separation of the scene, and hence data set, variables. The method relies on techniques for the modeling of surfaces and surface reflectance to render the synthesised scenes realistically.

#! An algorithm is presented for ray tracing generalized cylinders, that is, objects defined by sweeping a two-dimensional contour along a three-dimensional trajectory. The contour can be any 'well-behaved' curve in the sense that it is continuous, and that the points where the tangent is horizontal or vertical can be determined, the trajectory can be any spline curve. First a definition is given of generalized cylinders in terms of the Frenet frame of the trajectory. Then the main problem in ray tracing these objects, the computation of the intersection points with a ray, is reduced to the problem of intersecting two two-dimensional curves. This problem is solved by a subdivision algorithm. The three-dimensional normal at the intersection point closest to the eye point, necessary to perform shading, is obtained by transforming the two-dimensional normal at the corresponding intersection point of the two two-dimensional curves. In this way it is possible to obtain highly realistic images for a very broad class of objects.

(2) How do we find the control points for a subdivision of the original curve?

#@ Clark Thompson
#t 1986
#c Communications of the ACM
#! Most computer scientists know that the Department of Defense (DOD) supplies most of the funds for academic research, but few know how profoundly the funding situation has changed over the last decade. In 1976 most basic research in academic computer science was funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) [see Figure 1]. In 1985 NSF's "market share" is much less than DoD's.When applied research money is added in, as in Figure 2 (on the next page), DOD'S preeminence is even more marked. Allowing $25 million for industrial, state, institutional, and other support in 1985 (exact data are unavailable), I conclude that most academic computer science (CS) research is now directed by military agencies.

#! A classical problem in computational geometry is the planar point location problem. This problem calls for preprocessing a polygonal subdivision of the plane defined by n line segments so that, given a sequence of points, the polygon containing each point can be determined quickly on-line. Several ways of solving this problem in O(log n) query time and O(n) space are known, but they are all rather complicated. We propose a simple O(log n)-query-time, O(n)-space solution, using persistent search trees. A persistent search tree differs from an ordinary search tree in that after an insertion or deletion, the old version of the tree can still be accessed. We develop a persistent form of binary search tree that supports insertions and deletions in the present and queries in the past. The time per query or update is O(log m), where m is the total number of updates, and the space needed is O(1) per update. Our planar point location algorithm is an immediate application of this data structure. The structure also provides an alternative to Chazelle's "hive graph" structure, which has a variety of applications in geometric retrieval.

#! Decision Support Systems (DSSs), computer-based systems intended to assist managers in preparing and analyzing decisions, have been single-user systems for most of the past decade. Only recently has DSS research begun to study the implications of the fact that most complex managerial decisions involve multiple decision makers and analysts. A number of tools for facilitating group decisions have been proposed under the label Group Decision Support Systems (GDSSs).One of the most important functions of a GDSS is to provide problem-oriented services for communication among decision makers. On the basis of an analysis of the communication requirements in various group decision settings, this paper presents an architecture for defining and enforcing dynamic application-level protocols that organize decision group interaction. The architecture has been implemented on a network of personal computers in Co-oP, a GDSS for cooperative group decision making based on interactive, multiple-criteria decision methods.

#! A society model, which characterizes the behavior and procedure of offices, is proposed. It is our belief that an office system capable of dealing with all real office problems only through the modeling of the internal behavior of an office can be developed. In this society model, office entities are viewed as agents. An agent is modeled as a microsociety of interacting knowledge sources. Within the microsociety, there exists a microknowledge exchange system, which provides a set of microknowledge exchange protocols as a coordination system among those knowledge sources during their cooperative reasoning process. An office is then modeled as a society of various interacting agents using their knowledge to complete the office goals cooperatively. It is this unified view that allows offices to be modeled in a flexible and general way.

#! A system for generating direct manipulation office systems is described. In these systems, the user directly manipulates graphical representations of office entities instead of dealing with these entities abstractly through a command language or menu system. These systems employ a new semantic data model to describe office entities. New techniques based on attribute grammars and incremental attribute evaluation are used to implement this data model in an efficient manner. In addition, the system provides a means of generating sophisticated graphics-based user interfaces that are integrated with the underlying semantic model. Finally, the generated systems contain a general user reversal and recovery (or undo) mechanism that allows them to be much more tolerant of human errors.

#! The standard, most efficient method to retrieve information from databases can be described as systematic retrieval: The needs of the user are described in a formal query, and the database management system retrieves the data promptly. There are several situations, however, in which systematic retrieval is difficult or even impossible. In such situations exploratory search (browsing) is a helpful alternative. This paper describes a new user interface, called BAROQUE, that implements exploratory searches in relational databases. BAROQUE requires few formal skills from its users. It does not assume knowledge of the principles of the relational data model or familiarity with the organization of the particular database being accessed. It is especially helpful when retrieval targets are vague or cannot be specified satisfactorily. BAROQUE establishes a view of the relational database that resembles a semantic network, and provides several intuitive functions for scanning it. The network integrates both schema and data, and supports access by value. BAROQUE can be implemented on top of any basic relational database management system but can be modified to take advantage of additional capabilities and enhancements often present in relational systems.

#! The solution of a nonlinear optimization problem often requires an estimate of the Hessian matrix for a function f. In large scale problems, the Hessian matrix is usually sparse, and then estimation by differences of gradients is attractive because the number of differences can be small compared to the dimension of the problem. In this paper we describe a set of subroutines whose purpose is to estimate the Hessian matrix with the least possible number of gradient evaluations.

#! We consider the collocation method for linear, second-order elliptic problems on rectangular and general two-dimensional domains. An overview of the method is given for general domains, followed by a discussion of the improved efficiencies and simplifications possible for rectangular domains. A very-high-level description is given of three specific collocation algorithms that use Hermite bicubic basic functions, (1) GENCOL (collocation on general two-dimensional domains), (2) HERMCOL (collocation on rectangular domains with general linear boundary conditions), and (3) INTCOL (collocation on rectangular domains with uncoupled boundary conditions). The linear system resulting from INTCOL has half the bandwidth of that from HERMCOL, which provides substantial benefit in solving the system. We provide some examples showing the range of applicability of the algorithms and some performance profiles illustrating their efficiency. Fortran implementations of these algorithms are given in the companion papers [10, 11].

#! We describe a new package, UNCMIN, for finding a local minimizer of a real valued function of more than one variable. The novel feature of UNCMIN is that it is a modular system of algorithms, containing three different step selection strategies (line search, dogleg, and optimal step) that may be combined with either analytic or finite difference gradient evaluation and with either analytic, finite difference, or BFGS Hessian approximation. We present the results of a comparison of the three step selection strategies on the problems in More, Garbow, and Hillstrom in two separate cases: using finite difference gradients and Hessians, and using finite difference gradients with BFGS Hessian approximations. We also describe a second package, REVMIN, that uses optimization algorithms identical to UNCMIN but obtains values of user-supplied functions by reverse communication.

#! Three general principles are presented that can be applied in early software life cycle stages for the definition of software requirements and designs with acceptable performance. They are genuine high-level considerations for meeting responsiveness goals without sacrificing understandability and maintainability, and without increasing development time and cost. The principles are derived from the interrelationships of two performance models: a queueing network based on computer system model and an execution graph software model. The performance effect of each of the principles is quantified using the models. Examples are given that illustrate how they can be applied to software systems.

#! Replication can enhance the availability of data in distributed systems. This paper introduces a new method for managing replicated data. Unlike many methods that support replication only for uninterpreted files, this method systematically exploits type-specific properties of objects such as sets, queues, or directories to provide more effective replication. Each operation requires the cooperation of a certain number of sites for its successful completion. A quorum for an operation is any such set of sites. Necessary and sufficient constraints on quorum intersections are derived from an analysis of the data type's algebraic structure. A reconfiguration method is proposed that permits quorums to be changed dynamically. By taking advantage of type-specific properties in a general and systematic way, this method can realize a wider range of availability properties and more flexible reconfiguration than comparable replication methods.

#! Many distributed systems replicate data for fault tolerance or availability. In such systems, a logical update on a data item results in a physical update on a number of copies. The synchronization and communication required to keep the copies of replicated data consistent introduce a delay when operations are performed. In this paper, we describe a technique that relaxes the usual degree of synchronization, permitting replicated data items to be updated concurrently with other operations, while at the same time ensuring that correctness is not violated. The additional concurrency thus obtained results in better response time when performing operations on replicated data. We also discuss how this technique performs in conjunction with a roll-back and a roll-forward failure recovery mechanism.

#! The scheduling of jobs for multiprogramming systems includes the selection of jobs to be loaded into memory (job loading policy or memory schedule) and the scheduling for CPU processing (CPU schedule). There has been a successful empirical claim for the optimal CPU schedule; its optimality has been proved in a Markovian model of job-stream processing that uses the first-come-first-loaded (FCFL) job loading policy. We extend this model to gain insight into the effects of job loading policies.The model studied consists of an input stream of jobs of two classes and a multiple-resource system (the model of a multiprogramming system) with a stack for waiting jobs. The system consists of a finite amount of memory and a cyclic queue of a single (CPU) server station and a multiple (I/O) server station. The values of parameters describing each class of jobs are distinct except the mean I/O service time and the amount of memory required. The estimate of the maximum processing capacity (throughput bound) of the system is obtained and is shown to be achieved by the combination of the empirically claimed optimal CPU schedule and a job loading policy whereby the set of jobs in memory is kept to be (nearly) balanced with respect to the job stream. Furthermore, we show that the job loading policies independent of the system status have no improvement over the FCFL policy.Our investigation, supported by numerical calculations, suggests that much more care may be needed in implementing the job loading policy that aims at the optimal processing capacity than in implementing the optimal CPU schedule. This agrees with what has been conjectured on the basis of empirical studies.

#! We study algorithms for computing the equijoin of two relations in a system with a standard architecture hut with large amounts of main memory. Our algorithms are especially efficient when the main memory available is a significant fraction of the size of one of the relations to he joined; but they can be applied whenever there is memory equal to approximately the square root of the size of one relation. We present a new algorithm which is a hybrid of two hash-based algorithms and which dominates the other algorithms we present, including sort-merge. Even in a virtual memory environment, the hybrid algorithm dominates all the others we study.Finally, we describe how three popular tools to increase the efficiency of joins, namely filters, Babb arrays, and semijoins, can he grafted onto any of our algorithms.

Tracing his experience as a pioneer in highly theoretical computer science, Karp describes how the decision to go against established wisdom led to the work for which he is best known and how a colleague's findings led him to see links between two previously unrelated areas. Throughout, he stresses the exchange of ideas with colleagues that helped yield fundamental insights.

An easy computation of primary decomposition in such rings is deduced. Another consequence is a natural factorisation of the resultant of two univariate polynomials over the integers which is a generalisation of the ''reduced discriminant'' of a polynomial of degree 2.

The approach presented here unifies the computational framework for the inversion of both the numerical and polynomial matrices and provides the possibility for parallel implementation using array processors. This algorithm requires O(m^34^l^o^g^R) polynomial multiplications over a field, where m is the order of the matrix and the R the maximal degree of the rational polynomial element in the generalised inverse.

The procedure consists of three mutually exclusive cases. In the first two cases a generalised procedure for completing squares is used to limit the error functions which can appear in the integral to a finite number. This reduces the problem to the solution of a differential equation and we use a result of Risch (1969) to solve it. The third case can be reduced to the determination of what we have termed E-decompositions. The result presented here is the key procedure to a more general algorithm which is described fully in Cherry (1983).

We show exactly when fourth roots enable denesting of expressions not denestable with square roots only, When we restrict our attention to denesting over the real numbers, we show in fact that no roots other than square roots or fourth roots are ever useful for denesting expressions containing square roots only, thus characterising the denestable expressions in this case . We then proceed to describe new algorithms that accomplish such denesting.

#* Simplification of expressions involving radicals
#@ Richard Zippel
#t 1985
#c Journal of Symbolic Computation
#! Algebraically dependent expressions arise in a large variety of symbolic computations. People seem to have the best intuition about expressions involving radicals. Symbolic computations with simple, non-nested, radicals is relatively straightforward; however, when the radicals are nested the problem becomes more difficult, This paper presents an algorithm for determining a linearly independent basis for a set of radicals (nested or not). This allows elementary techniques to be used for arithmetic operations on expressions involving elements of this set. In addition we provide a structure theorem that provides a sufficient condition for a nested radical to be expressed in terms of radicals of lower nesting level. These two techniques are powerful tools for computations involving radicals.

We also introduce the powerful concept of an I path which is used to transfer data unchanged from one place in a circuit to another. The process of embedding a test schema into an actual circuit is described. This produces a test plan for the circuit which specifies the sequence of actions that need to be carried out to execute the test. A theory of test plan execution overlap is presented, and is used as the basis for constructing test schedules with optimal execution times.

#! The time interval between the occurrence of a fault and the detection of the error caused by the fault is divided by the generation of that error into two parts: fault latency and error latency. Since the moment of error generation is not directly observable, all related works in the literature have dealt with only the sum of fault and error latencies, thereby making the analysis of their separate effects impossible. To remedy this deficiency, we 1) present a new methodology for indirectly measuring fault latency, 2) derive the distribution of fault latency from the methodology, and 3) apply the knowledge of fault latency to the analysis of two important examples.

A functional fault model is developed independent of the implementation details of the circuit. A generalized D algorithm is proposed for generating tests to detect functional as well as gate-level faults. Algorithms which perform fault excitation, implication, D propagation, and line justification on the functional modules are also described.

Using this technique, all multiple stuck-at faults, as well as all multiple extra and multiple missing device faults, are detected.

#! Recently developed inferential database systems face some common problems: a very fast growth of search space and difficulties in recognizing inference termination (especially for recursive axioms). These shortcomings stem mainly from the fact that the inference process is usually separated from database operations. A problem-oriented inferential system i8 described which refers to the database prior to query (or subquery) processing, so that the inference from the very beginning is directed by data relevant to the query. A multiprocessor implementation of the system is presented based on a computer network conforming to database relations and axioms. The system provides an efficient indication of query termination, and is complete in the sense that it produces all correct answers to a query in a finite time.

#! In a faulty distributed system, voting is commonly used to achieve mutual exclusion among groups of nodes. Each node is assigned a number of votes, and any group with a majority of votes can perform the critical operations. Vote assignments can have a significant impact on system reliability, and in this paper we study the vote assignment problem. To compare vote assignments we define two deterministic measures, node and edge vulnerability. We present various properties of these measures and discuss how they can be computed. For these measures we discuss the selection of the best assignment and propose heuristics to identify good candidate assignments.

#! This paper demonstrates a practical approach to the study of the failure behavior of computer systems. Particular attention is devoted to the analysis of permanent failures. A number of important techniques, which may have general applicability in both failure and workload analysis, are brought together in this presentation. These include: smeared averaging of the workload data, clustering of like failures, and joint analysis of workload and failures. Approximately 17 percent of all failures affecting the CPU were estimated to be permanent. The manifestation of a permanent failure was found to be strongly correlated with the level and type of workload prior to the failure. Although, in strict terms, the results only relate to the manifestation of permanent failures and not to their occurrence, there are strong indications that permanent failures are both caused and discovered by increased activity. More measurements and experiments are necessary to determine their respective contributions to the measured workload/failure relationship.

#! This paper studies the performance of single-user workstations that access files remotely over a local area network. From the environmental, economic, and administrative points of view, workstations that are diskless or that have limited secondary storage are desirable at the present time. Even with changing technology, access to shared data will continue to be important. It is likely that some performance penalty must be paid for remote rather than local file access. Our objectives are to assess this penalty and to explore a number of design alternatives that can serve to minimize it. Our approach is to use the results of measurement experiments to parameterize queuing network performance models. These models then are used to assess performance under load and to evahrate design alternatives. The major conclusions of our study are: (1) A system of diskless workstations with a shared file server can have satisfactory performance. By this, we mean performance comparable to that of a local disk in the lightly loaded case, and the ability to support substantial numbers of client workstations without significant degradation. As with any shared facility, good design is necessary to minimize queuing delays under high load. (2) The key to efficiency is protocols that allow volume transfers at every interface (e.g., between client and server, and between disk and memory at the server) and at every level (e.g., between client and server at the level of logical request/response and at the level of local area network packet size). However, the benefits of volume transfers are limited to moderate sizes (8-16 kbytes) by several factors. (3) From a performance point of view, augmenting the capabilities of the shared file server may be more cost effective than augmenting the capabilities of the client workstations. (4) Network contention should not be a performance problem for a lo-Mbit network and 100 active workstations in a software development environment.

#! An exploratory study of computerized performance monitoring and control systems reveals both positive and negative effects. Responses of 50 clerical workers from 2 organizations with computerized monitoring were compared to 94 individuals from 3 organizations in similar jobs without computerized monitoring. The results indicate that computerized monitoring is associated with perceived increases in office productivity, more accurate and complete assessment of workers' performance, and higher levels of organizational control. Respondents indicate that managers overemphasize the importance of quantity and underemphasize the importance of quality in evaluating employee performance. Workers perceive increased stress, lower levels of satisfaction, and a decrease in the quality of their relationships with peers and management as a consequence of computerized monitoring. The relevance of existing models of performance monitoring is examined in light of these findings.

#! In this paper we present a new data structure for representing Boolean functions and an associated set of manipulation algorithms. Functions are represented by directed, acyclic graphs in a manner similar to the representations introduced by Lee [1] and Akers [2], but with further restrictions on the ordering of decision variables in the graph. Although a function requires, in the worst case, a graph of size exponential in the number of arguments, many of the functions encountered in typical applications have a more reasonable representation. Our algorithms have time complexity proportional to the sizes of the graphs being operated on, and hence are quite efficient as long as the graphs do not grow too large. We present experimental results from applying these algorithms to problems in logic design verification that demonstrate the practicality of our approach.

#! The "hit ratio" of a high-speed buffer (cache) depends on the "locality" of memory references. However, locality of reference is disturbed and the hit ratio decreases whenever a task switch occurs. This performance degradation can be minimized if "locality of task switching," the tendency for a small set of favored tasks to be frequently executed, exists and the cache is organized in such a way that it can hold blocks (lines) of multiple tasks. Locality of task switching and locality of memory references in individual tasks exhibit overall locality of memory references at a system level. This paper addresses the following questions. Does locality of task switching really exist? How can it be modeled? Task switching in IBM operating system/virtual storage with multiple virtual storage (OS/VS2 MVS) was measured using event traces for three different workloads to show that locality of task switching actually exists in MVS. Two different models of task switching are proposed. These models can be incorporated into cache multitasking models to predict more accurately the misses in real computer systems. A key parameter of these models is the task execution interval; measurements of execution intervals for the workloads used in the paper are presented and discussed.

The main results of the paper are the algebraic operation model and the description of detection capability of a new three-state data stream compressor consisting of decoder 3/2 and a two-input shift register TISR. In particular, the properties of the unit decoder 3/2 TISR in detecting faults of the s-a-0, s- a-1, and s-a-HZ type are discussed. In this paper important aspects of the application of the new compressor are given. An example of the new compressor's performance scheme is also described. An additional result of this paper is the description of the operation model and the detection capability of the multiinput shift register MISR in which the most significant bit and other selected flip-flop output signals are fed back to the least significant bit positions via Exclusive-OR gates outside the flip-flops.

#! In this paper, potential invalidation of stuck-open fault-detecting tests, derived by neglecting circuit delays and charge distribution in CMOS logic circuits, is studied. Several classes of circuits derived from sum of products and product of sums expressions for a given combinational logic function are investigated to determine the testability of FET stuck-open faults by tests which will remain valid in the presence of arbitrary circuit delays. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of tests that will remain valid in the presence of arbitrary circuit delays are derived. Using these conditions, it is shown that all single FET stuck-open faults, in a specific design using a single CMOs complex gate, are detectable by tests that remain valid in the presence of arbitrary circuit delays. For several other realizations, methods to augment them, to insure detectability of all single FET stuck-open faults by tests that will remain valid in the presence of arbitrary circuit delays are proposed. It is observed that in many of the logic circuits investigated it is also possible to avoid test invalidation due to charge distribution.

The algorithm is also simple in computation, iterative in nature, and very suitable for machine implementation.

#! A state transition model for the optimization of query processing in a distributed database system is presented. The problem is parameterized by means of a state describing the amount of processing that has been performed at each site where the database is located. A state transition occurs each time a new join or semijoin is executed. Dynamic programming is used to compute recursively the costs of the states and the globally optimal solution, taking into account communication and local processing costs. The state transition model is general enough to account for the possibility of parallel processing among the various sites, as well as for redundancy in the database. The model also permits significant reductions of the necessary computations by taking advantage of simple additivity and site-uniformity properties of a cost model, and of clever strategies that improve on the basic dynamic programming algorithm.

The study therefore enables a comparison of the different language approaches to be made.

In one form this is commonly referred to as the "bin-picking" problem, in which the parts to be recognized are presented in a jumbled bin. The paper is organized according to 2-D, 2½-D, and 3-D object representations, which are used as the basis for the recognition algorithms. Three central issues common to each category, namely, feature extraction, modeling, and matching, are examined in detail. An evaluation and comparison of existing industrial part-recognition systems and algorithms is given, providing insights for progress toward future robot vision systems.

#! This paper presents an overview of the Cedar programming environment, focusing on its overall structure—that is, the major components of Cedar and the way they are organized. Cedar supports the development of programs written in a single programming language, also called Cedar. Its primary purpose is to increase the productivity of programmers whose activities include experimental programming and the development of prototype software systems for a high-performance personal computer. The paper emphasizes the extent to which the Cedar language, with run-time support, has influenced the organization, flexibility, usefulness, and stability of the Cedar environment. It highlights the novel system features of Cedar, including automatic storage management of dynamically allocated typed values, a run-time type system that provides run-time access to Cedar data type definitions and allows interpretive manipulation of typed values, and a powerful device-independent imaging modelthat supports the user interface facilities. Using these discussions to set the context, the paper addresses the language and system features and the methodologies used to facilitate the integration of Cedar applications. A comparison of Cedar with other programming environments further identifies areas where Cedar excels and areas where work remains to be done.

#! PegsSys is an experimental system in which a user formally describes how a program is put together by means of a hierarchically structured collection of pictures, called formal dependency diagrams (FDDs). Icons in an FDD denote a wide range of data and control dependencies among the relatively coarse-grained entities contained in large programs. Dependencies considered atomic with respect to one level in a hierarchy can be decomposed into a number of dependencies at a lower level. Each dependency can be a predefined primitive of the FDD language or it can be defined by a PegaSys user in terms of the primitives.A PegsSys user is given the illusion that logical formulas do not exist, even though PegaSys reasons about them internally. This involves (1) checking whether an FDD is meaningful syntactically, (2) determining whether hierarchical refinements of an FDD are methodologically sound, and (3) deciding whether an FDD hierarchy is logically consistent with the program that it is intended to describe. The techniques used to provide these capabilities are discussed along with the logical properties that enable PegaSys to maintain the user illusion.

#! Traditional discrete-event simulations employ an inherently sequential algorithm. In practice, simulations of large systems are limited by this sequentiality, because only a modest number of events can be simulated. Distributed discrete-event simulation (carried out on a network of processors with asynchronous message-communicating capabilities) is proposed as an alternative; it may provide better performance by partitioning the simulation among the component processors. The basic distributed simulation scheme, which uses time encoding, is described. Its major shortcoming is a possibility of deadlock. Several techniques for deadlock avoidance and deadlock detection are suggested. The focus of this work is on the theory of distributed discrete-event simulation.

#! This paper addresses the problem of optimizing queries that involve set operations (set queries) in a distributed relational database system. A particular emphasis is put on the optimization of such queries in horizontally partitioned database systems. A mathematical programming model of the set query problem is developed and its NP-completeness is proved. Solution procedures are proposed and computational results presented. One of the main results of the computational experiments is that, for many queries, the solution procedures are not sensitive to errors in estimating the size of results of set operations.

#! In spite of substantial progress in the theory of interprocedural data flow analysis, few practical compiling systems can afford to apply it to produce more efficient object programs. To perform interprocedural analysis, a compiler needs not only the source code of the module being compiled, but also information about the side effects of every procedure in the program containing that module, even separately compiled procedures. In a conventional batch compiler system, the increase in compilation time required to gather this information would make the whole process impractical. In an integrated programming environment, however, other tools can cooperate with the compiler to compute the necessary interprocedural information incrementally. as the program is being developed, decreasing both the overall cost of the analysis and the cost of individual compilations.A central goal of the Rn project at Rice University is to construct a prototype software development environment that is designed to build whole programs, rather than just individual modules. It employs interprocedural analysis and optimization to produce high-quality machine code for whole programs. This paper presents an overview of the methods used by the environment to accomplish this task and discusses the impact of these methods on the various environment components. The responsibilities of each component of the environment for the preparation and use of interprocedural information are presented in detail.

Properties are proved about INSTANCE, a theorem prover module that recognizes that a formula is a special case and/or an alphabetic variant of another formula, and about INSURER, another theorem prover module that decomposes a problem, represented by a formula, into independent subproblems, using a conjunction. The main result of INSTANCE is soundness; the main result of INSURER is a maximum decomposition into subproblems (with some provisos). Experimental results show that a connection graph theorem prover extended with these modules is more effective than the resolution-based connection graph theorem prover alone.

#! The problem of recognizing what objects are where in the workspace of a robot can be cast as one of searching for a consistent matching between sensory data elements and equivalent model elements. In principle, this search space is enormous, and to control the potential combinatorial explosion, constraints between the data and model elements are needed. A set of constraints for sparse sensory data that are applicable to a wide variety of sensors are derived, and their characteristics are examined. Known bounds on the complexity of constraint satisfaction problems are used, together with explicit estimates of the effectiveness of the constraints derived for the case of sparse, noisy, three-dimensional sensory data, to obtain general theoretical bounds on the number of interpretations expected to be consistent with the data. It is shown that these bounds are consistent with empirical results reported previously. The results are used to demonstrate the graceful degradation of the recognition technique with the presence of noise in the data, and to predict the number of data points needed, in general, to uniquely determine the object being sensed.

Unfortunately, the published initialization procedure can be extremely time consuming. This paper considers an alternative method of initialization based on a natural polynomial representation for the terms of a feedback shift register sequence that results in substantial improvements in the initialization process.

#! Four semantics for a small programming language involving unbounded (but countable) nondeterminism are provided. These comprise an operational semantics, two state transformation semantics based on the Egli-Milner and Smyth orders, respectively, and a weakest precondition semantics. Their equivalence is proved. A Hoare-like proof system for total correctness is also introduced and its soundness and completeness in an appropriate sense are shown. Finally, the recursion theoretic complexity of the notions introduced is studied. Admission of countable nondeterminism results in a lack of continuity of various semantic functions, and this is shown to be necessary for any semantics satisfying appropriate conditions. In proofs of total correctness, one resorts to the use of (countable) ordinals, and it is shown that all recursive ordinals are needed.

#! RECAL, a Recursion by Chain Algorithm for computing the mean performance measures of product-form multiple-chain closed queuing networks, is presented. It is based on a new recursive expression that relates the normalization constant of a network with r closed routing chains to those of a set of networks having (r - 1) chains. It relies on the artifice of breaking down each chain into constituent subchains that each have a population of one. The time and space requirements of the algorithm are shown to be polynomial in the number of chains. When the network contains many routing chains, the proposed algorithm is substantially more efficient than the convolution or mean value analysis algorithms. The algorithm, therefore, extends the range of queuing networks that can be analyzed efficiently by exact means.

#! The accessibility problem for linear sequential machines [12] is the problem of deciding whether there is an input x such that on x the machine starting in a given state q1 goes to a given state q2. Harrison shows that this problem is reducible to the following simply stated linear algebra problem, which we call the "orbit problem":Given (n, A, x, y), where n is a natural number and A, x, and y are nxn, nx1, and nx1 matrices of rationals, respectively, decide whether there is a natural number I such that Aix=y.He conjectured that the orbit problem is decidable. No progress was made on the conjecture for ten years until Shank [22] showed that if n is fixed at 2, then the problem is decidable. This paper shows that the orbit problem for general n is decidable and indeed decidable in polynomial time. The orbit problem arises in several contexts; two of these, linear recurrences and the discrete logarithm problem for polynomials, are discussed, and we apply our algorithm for the orbit problem in these contexts.

The exponential function presented here returns a result which differs from ex by less than one unit in the last place, for any representable value of x which is not too close to values for which ex would overflow or underflow. (For values of x which are not within this range, an error condition is raised.) It is a 聯variable precision聰 function in that it returns a p-digit approximation for a p-digit argument, for any p = 0 (p-digit means p-decimal-digit). The program and analysis are valid for all p = 0, but current implementations place a restriction on p. The program is presented in a Pascal-like programming language called Numerical Turing which has special facilities for scientific computing, including precision control, directed roundings, and built-in functions for getting and setting exponents.

#! For a given sparse symmetric positive definite matrix, a compact row-oriented storage scheme for its Cholesky factor is introduced. The scheme is based on the structure of an elimination tree defined for the given matrix. This new storage scheme has the distinct advantage of having the amount of overhead storage required for indexing always bounded by the number of nonzeros in the original matrix. The structural representation may be viewed as storing the minimal structure of the given matrix that will preserve the symbolic Cholesky factor. Experimental results on practical problems indicate that the amount of savings in overhead storage can be substantial when compared with Sherman's compressed column storage scheme.

The paper illustrates how “mathematical hardware” packages, as well as software library routines, may be part of the mathematical problem solver's tool kit in the future.

#! This paper examines mathematical programming software in the context of model management and decision support. The concept of a model management system (MMS) is introduced and compared to traditional modeling systems. An MMS is seen as a much more generalized software system that requires the confluence of existing operations research, database management, and artificial intelligence techniques. By incorporating powerful, abstraction-based representation structures, an MMS can support multiple levels of model abstraction, only one of which corresponds to traditional, solution-oriented modeling software. The database structures required to implement a knowledge-based MMS are discussed and a prototype system for mathematical programming, the Generalized eXperimental Math Programming system (GXMP), is described. An algebraic language developed for use in GXMP is described in detail.

#! A constructive theory of randomness for functions, based on computational complexity, is developed, and a pseudorandom function generator is presented. This generator is a deterministic polynomial-time algorithm that transforms pairs (g, r), where g is any one-way function and r is a random k-bit string, to polynomial-time computable functions ƒr: {1, … , 2k} → {1, … , 2k}. These ƒr's cannot be distinguished from random functions by any probabilistic polynomial-time algorithm that asks and receives the value of a function at arguments of its choice. The result has applications in cryptography, random constructions, and complexity theory.

#! The ability to generate language-based editors depends on the existence of a powerful, language-independent model of editing. A model is proposed in which programs are represented as attributed abstract-syntax trees with an associated relational database. Relations can depend on the state of the attributed tree, and attributes can depend on the values in relations, provided there are no circular dependencies.The power and the limitations of relational operations are demonstrated with respect to the support of static-semantic checking, anomaly detection, an interrogation facility, and the ability to define alternative program displays. The advantages of the hybrid system over both the purely relational and purely attribute-based systems are presented, and new algorithms are given for query evaluation and incremental view updating motivated by the efficiency requirements of interactive editing under the defined model. A prototype implementation of an editor generator is described, and suggestions for future research are made.

#! A number of multiversion concurrency control algorithms have been proposed in the past few years. These algorithms use previous versions of data items in order to improve the level of achievable concurrency. This paper describes a simulation study of the performance of several multiversion concurrency control algorithms, investigating the extent to which they provide increases in the level of concurrency and also the CPU, I/O, and storage costs resulting from the use of multiple versions. The multiversion algorithms are compared with regard to performance with their single-version counterparts and also with each other. It is shown that each multiversion algorithm offers significant performance improvements despite the additional disk accesses involved in accessing old versions of data; the nature of the improvement depends on the algorithm in question. It is also shown that the storage overhead for maintaining old versions that may be required by ongoing transactions is not all that large under most circumstances. Finally, it is demonstrated that it is important for version maintenance to be implemented efficiently, as otherwise the cost of maintaining old versions could outweigh their concurrency benefits.

Ideas from conceptual mathematics, symbolic computation, and computer science can be utilized within the framework of scientific computing and have an important role to play in that area.

#! A simple algorithm is given which takes an arbitrary binary search tree and rebalances it to form another of optimal shape, using time linear in the number of nodes and only a constant amount of space (beyond that used to store the initial tree). This algorithm is therefore optimal in its use of both time and space. Previous algorithms were optimal in at most one of these two measures, or were not applicable to all binary search trees. When the nodes of the tree are stored in an array, a simple addition to this algorithm results in the nodes being stored in sorted order in the initial portion of the array, again using linear time and constant space.

#! A simple implementation of double-ended priority queues is presented. The proposed structure, called a min-max heap, can be built in linear time; in contrast to conventional heaps, it allows both FindMin and FindMax to be performed in constant time; Insert, DeleteMin, and DeleteMax operations can be performed in logarithmic time. Min-max heaps can be generalized to support other similar order-statistics operations efficiently (e.g., constant time FindMedian and logarithmic time DeleteMedian); furthermore, the notion of min-max ordering can be extended to other heap-ordered structures, such as leftist trees.

#! It is assumed that long wires represent large capacitive loads, and the effect on the area of a VLSI layout when drivers are introduced along many long wires in the layout is investigated. A layout is presented for which the introduction of standard drivers along long wires squares the area of the layout; it is shown, however, that the increase in area is never greater than the layout's area squared if the driver can be laid out in a square region. This paper also shows an area-time trade-off for the driver of a single long wire of length / by which the area of the driver from &THgr;(l), to &THgr;(lq), q ll-q) rather than &THgr;(log l) can be tolerated. Tight bounds are also obtained on the worst-case area increase in general layouts having these drivers.

The algorithm is so arranged that if no solution is found, then no solution can exist.

#! Computational methods for finding the character table of a finite group require a stock of reducible characters and techniques for decomposing these characters into irreducible characters. A method for generating reducible characters from a representation of a group is proposed. Several new techniques for computing the irreducible decompositions of a set of characters are given; these techniques extend earlier results of Conway and M. Guy.

#! The present author as well as Andreka's group has experienced, while writing program- verifying programs, the following dilemma. We have to decide which program verification method (i.e. logic of programs) to choose as a framework for our software system. It is not obvious that the strongest method is also the best because it might overload the theorem prover subprogram. So we have to optimise. But for this we need as much information and insight as possible into the natures of available methods. Non-standard algorithmic logic of dynamic logic (NDL from now on) is a complete first order logic with a decidable proof concept for reasoning about programs, developed in 1978 by H. Andreka et al. NDL unifies existing approaches to program verification and turns incompleteness results into completeness results. Still, it is far from being popular and this is because non-standard models of computation are unpopular. It is the aim of the present paper to show that these models play for dynamic logic the same role which, say, complex numbers, play for physics. They are merely a tool for proving very realistic, standard properties of programs (e.g. non-provability by a given standard method) or for reasoning about (existing) program verification methods. The paper also provides two essential proofs, which are missing in their complete or proper form from the publications.

#! Some notes on the computation of Groebner Bases using Buchberger's algorithm over different coefficient domains and the solution of systems of algebraic equations using Groebner bases are given. Examples demonstrate applicability and its current timits, and show the wide range of problems tractable by this method. The choices of an appropriate variable ordering and a suitable term ordering are of crucial importance for the computing time and space allocation. The ''optimal'' variable ordering is considered, and an improvement for the selection of wdid solutions of the system of algebraic equations is described.

#* Computing character degrees in p-groups
#@ Michael C. Slattery
#t 1986
#c Journal of Symbolic Computation
#! This paper presents a reeursive procedure for computing the degrees of the irreducible complex characters of a finite p-group by working up a central series in the group. A program written in the computer group theory language CAVLE7 is presented which implements this algorithm assuming that the p-group is given in terms of a power-commutator presentation. Some times for sample runs are presented which indicate that the CAYLEY implementation is effective for groups of order up to p^1^5 for small primes. In particular, this approach seems to produce the character degrees much faster than using CAYLEY,''S built-in character table function and reading off the degrees.

#* Proving geometric algorithm non-solvability: An application of factoring polynomials
#@ Chanderjit Bajaj
#t 1986
#c Journal of Symbolic Computation
#! We explain how factoring polynomials modulo primes can be used in proving that for certain geometric optimisation problems there exists no exact algorithm under models of computation where the root of an algebraic equation is obtained using arithmetic operations and the extraction of kth roots. This leaves only numerical or symbolic approximations to the solution of these problems under these models. This letter describes work which is described in more detail in Bajaj (1984)-here we concentrate on the use of computer algebra, in particular factoring polynomials over the rationals using the MACSVMA system.

#t 1986
#c Journal of Symbolic Computation
#! We determine piston trajectories yielding maximum work output from two variations of a light-driven engine: one is a free-piston engine; the other is an optimally controlled engine. The equations describing the optimal piston path of the controlled engine are generated by the symbolic processing program MACSYMA. A second set of computer algebra routines are used to perform a stability analysis of the coupled, non-linear differential equations describing the piston trajectories. From this analysis we generate parameter sets that allow a numerical program, which solves systems of differential equations with mixed boundary conditions, to determine etiieientty the explicit time-path of the optimally controlled engine.

#! Given the set @? of terms, a congruence ~ on @? and a set N of representatives for ~, we say a term rewriting system (TRS) R defines (~, N) if ~ is the congruence defined by R and N is the set of R-normal forms. We give necessary and sufficient syntactical conditions on (~, N) to be definable by a TRS. It turns out that (~, N) may be definable by a TRS but not by a uniquely terminating one. In order to find a minimal TRS defining (~, N) we construct the reduced TRS for (~, N). The reduced TRS R may fail to define (~, N), but if every term has an R-normal form, then it is a minimal TRS defining (~, N).

To give a framework for the investigation of implementations we define a complete and consistent model, which retains full invertibility and allows separation of logic and control. Some existing implementations are discussed from this viewpoint. An extended unification algorithm is suggested, which incorporates the features demanded by our model.

#! It is well known that various notions of distinguished bases of ideals, such as standard and Grobner bases, and algorithms for constructing them, play a central role in solving algorithmic problems in polynomial ideal theory and related algebraic theories. In this paper a new structural algebraic framework is given for the concept and the construction of the so-called generalised standard bases. Although the spirit of this paper is more structural than algorithmic, the general results achieved should also help to shape and direct future research in the algorithmic aspects of commutative algebra.

#! Let B be a set of n"b black points and W a set of n"w, white points in the Euclidean plane. A line h is said to bisect B (or W) if, at most, half of the points of B (or W) lie on any one side of h. A line that bisects both B and W is called a ham-sandwich cut of B and W. We give an algorithm that computes a ham-sandwich cut of B and W in 0((n"h+n"w) log (min {n"b, n"w}+ 1)) time. The algorithm is considerably simpler than the previous most efficient one which takes 0((n"b + n"w) log (n"b + n"w)) time.

Brief sample sessions show the user syntax and the mathematical power of the system for performing arithmetic, factoring, simplification, differentiation, integration, summation, solving algebraic equations, solving differential equations, series expansions, and matrix manipulations. Time and space statistics for each sample session show that the Maple system is very efficient in memory space utilisation, as well as in time. The Maple programming language is presented by describing the most commonly used features, using some non-trivial computations to illustrate the language features.

Character calculations are based on the methods of Dixon, in which calculations are done in modulo arithmetic; representations are recovered by induction as described by Altmann. These methods reduce the scale of the computation so that it may be accomplished within the limits of widely available microcomputers.

#! In this paper we describe a new class of orderings-associative path orderings-for proving termination of associative-commutative term rewriting systems .These orderings are based on the concept of simplification orderings and extend the well-known recursive path orderings to E - congruence classes, where E is an equational theory consisting of associativity and commutativity axioms. Associative path orderings are applicable to term rewriting systems for which a precedence ordering on the set of operator symbols can be defined that satisfies a certain condition,the associative path condition. The precedence ordering can often be derived from the structure of the reduction rules. We include termination proofs for various term rewriting systems (for rings,boolean algebra,etc.) and, in addition, point out ways to handle situations where the associative path condition is too restrictive.

The method is to find a Sylow p-subgroup P of G, where p =@?K@?, to compute H^x (P, M) first, using variants of the Nilpotent Quotient Algorithm, and then to compute H^x (G, M) as the subgroup of stable elements of H^x (P, M).

#! Our aim is to present a practical algorithm for the isomorphism problem that can be easily adapted to any class of combinatorial objects. We investigate the underlying principles of backtrack algorithms that determine a canonical representative of a combinatorial object. We identify the parts of the algorithm that are dependent on the class of combinatorial objects and those parts that are independent of the class. An interface between the two parts is developed to provide a general backtrack algorithm for the isomorphism problem of combinatorial objects that incorporates the technique of branch-and-bound, and that also uses the automorphisms of the combinatorial object to prune the search tree. Our general algorithm incorporates from computational group theory an algorithm known as the base change algorithm. The base change algorithm allows one to recover as much information as possible about the automorphism group when a new branch of the search tree is processed. Thus, it can lead to greater pruning of the search tree. This work is intended to lead to a better understanding of the practical isomorphism algorithms. It is not intended as a contribution to the theoretical study of the complexity of the isomorphism problem.

#! For a string rewriting system T on a finite alphabet @?, the word problem is the following decision problem: INSTANCE: Two words u, @u@?@?*. QUESTION:Are the words u, and @u congruent modulo T, i.e . can the word @u be derived from u in T? An algorithm @f for solving this problem is called a pseudo-natural algorithm, if on input u, @u@?@?*, / actually computes a derivation of v from a in T in case a and v are congruent modulo T. For many classes of monoids and groups, that are given through presentations involving finite string rewriting systems, the word problems are solved by pseudo-natural algorithms . Here, the following results concerning this class of algorithms are obtained: 1 . The degree of complexity of a pseudo-natural algorithm for solving the word problem for a finitely presented monoid is independent of the actually chosen finite presentation. 2. There exists a finitely presented monoid (in fact, even a group) such that every pseudonatural algorithm for solving the word problem for this monoid is of a high degree of complexity, although this problem is easily decidable. 3. Each finitely generated group G, the word problem for which is decidable, can be embedded in a finitely presented group H such that the word problem for H can be solved by a pseudo-natural algorithm that is of the same degree of complexity as the word problem for G.

#* The rate-distortion region for multiple descriptions without excess rate
#@ Rudolf Ahlswede
#t 1985
#c IEEE Transactions on Information Theory
#! During recent years there has been strong interest in a certain source coding problem, which some authors call the "problem of multiple descriptions." Old and new wringing techniques enable us to establish a single-letter characterization of the rate-distortion region in the case of no excess rate for the joint description.

#* Rate distortion when side information may be absent
#@ Chris Heegard;Toby Berger
#t 1985
#c IEEE Transactions on Information Theory
#! The problem is considered of encoding a discrete memoryless source when correlated side information may or may not be available to the decoder. It is assumed that the side information is not available to the encoder. The rate-distortion functionR (D_{l}, D_{2})is determined whereD_{1}is the distortion achieved with side information andD_{2}is the distortion achieved without it. A generalization is made to the case ofmdecoders, each of which is privy to its own side information. An appropriately definedD-admissible rate for this general case is shown to equalR(D)when the side information sources satisfy a specified degradedness condition. Explicit results are obtained in the quadratic Gaussian case and in the binary Hamming case.

#* Two-way source coding with a fidelity criterion
#@ Amiram H. Kaspi
#t 1985
#c IEEE Transactions on Information Theory
#! Let(X_{i}, Y_{i}), i= 1,2 cdots, be a sequence of independent, identically distributed bivariate random variables and consider the following communication situation. TheXcomponent of the process is observed at some location, sayA, while theYcomponent is observed at a different location, sayB. TheX(Y)component of the process has to be reproduced at locationB(A). It is desired to find the amount of information that should be exchanged between the two locations, so that the distortions incurred will not exceed some predetermined tolerance. A "single-letter characterization" of a certain region{cal****}^{K} subset {cal R}^{4}of rates and distortions is given. This region contains (all, and only) the achievable rates and distortions for the special case where block coding is used and the information is conveyed through a one-way link that can switch direction onlyKtimes per block.

For channels for which the random coding bound may be achieved by codes consisting of codewords of a single type for each sender, this bound is also achievable by codes produced by permutations.

#* A new entropy power inequality
#@ Max H.M. Costa
#t 1985
#c IEEE Transactions on Information Theory
#! A strengthened version of Shannon's entropy power inequality for the case where one of the random vectors involved is Gaussian is proved. In particular it is shown that if independent Gaussian noise is added to an arbitrary, multivariate random variable, the entropy power of the resulting random variable is a concave function of the variance (power) of the added noise. The strengthened inequality is shown to hold for the class of stable distributions.

#* A transform tree code for stationary Gaussian sources
#@ William A. Pearlman;Priyadarshan Jakatdar
#t 1985
#c IEEE Transactions on Information Theory
#! A new tree code is introduced for discrete-time stationary Gaussian sources with hounded, integrable power spectra and the squared-error distortion measure. The codewords in the tree are reconstructions of Karhunen-Loève transforms of the source words. The branching factor and the number of code letters per branch may vary with level in the tree. A theorem that guarantees the existence of an optimal code for any code rate using such a tree is proved. The proof uses the random coding argument in conjunction with a theorem on survival of a branching process with random environment. A suboptimal but computationally affordable realization of the theorem's coding technique was used for encoding simulations for six autoregressive sources at rates of1.0, 0.50, 0.25, and0.10bits per source symbol. The average distortion results were generally within1dB of the distortion-rate bound but varied widely depending on the source and rate. The results were compared with those for transform quantization simulations for the same sources and rates. The tree code always performed better but only by an average of0.44dB all sources and rates. Longer source blocks and more intensive search would certainly improve the performance of the tree codes, but at the expense of extra computation and storage.

#* An approximation to the weight distribution of binary linear codes
#@ Tadao Kasami;Tohru Fujiwara;Shu Lin
#t 1985
#c IEEE Transactions on Information Theory
#! Binary primitive BCH codes form a large class of powerful error-correcting codes. The weight distributions of primitive BCH codes are unknown except for some special classes, such as the single, double, triple error-correcting codes and some very low-rate primitive BCH codes. However, asymptotic results for the weight distribution of a large subclass of primitive BCH codes have been derived by Sidel'nikov. These results provide some insight into the weight structure of primitive BCH codes. Sidel'nikov's approach is improved and applied to the weight distribution of any binary linear block code. Then Sidel'nikov's results on the weight distributions of binary primitive BCH codes are improved and it is shown that the weights of a binary primitive code have approximate binomial distribution.

#* The concatenated structure of cyclic and Abelian codes
#@ Jorn M. Jensen
#t 1985

#! It is shown that a linear two-dimensional cyclic code of lengthnNcan be factorized into a direct sum of concatenated codes, with cyclic inner and outer codes and, conversely, thai a two-dimensional cyclic code can be constructed in this way. This result is extended, and it appears that the Abelian codes are obtainable by taking a direct sum of several concatenations of cyclic codes. Codes are constructed that are better than any previously known. In particular, low-rate cyclic codes superior to the duals of high-rate BCH codes are constructed.

#* Error recovery for variable length codes
#@ James C. Maxted;John P. Robinson
#t 1985
#c IEEE Transactions on Information Theory
#! When an error occurs in the encoded bit stream produced by a variable length code, the decoder may lose synchronization. A state model for synchronization recovery is developed, and a method for determining the expected span of source symbols lost is presented. The performance of various codes with respect to error recovery is discussed. Two examples are given where equivalent optimal codes have a marked difference in their error recovery characteristics. Some open problems are indicated.

#* Minimax robust coding for channels with uncertainty statistics
#@ Evangelos Geraniotis
#t 1985
#c IEEE Transactions on Information Theory
#! The problem of minimax robust coding for classes of channels with uncertainty in their statistical description is addressed. Specific consideration is given to: 1) discrete memoryless channels with uncertainty in the probability transition matrices; 2) discrete-time stationary Gaussian channels with spectral uncertainty; and to uncertainty with classes determined by 2-alternating Choquet capacities. Both block codes and convolutional codes are considered. A robust maximum-likelihood decoding rule is derived; the rule guarantees that, for all channels in the uncertainty class and all rates smaller than a critical rate, the average probability of decoding error for the ensemble of random block codes and the ensemble of random time-varying convolutional codes converges to zero exponentially with increasing block length or constraint length, respectively. The channel capacity and cut-off rate of the class are then evaluated.

#@ Cheng-Tie Chen;Saleem A Kassam

#c IEEE Transactions on Information Theory
#! Robust matched filtering is considered for multiple-input systems, with problems formulated in both frequency and time domains being given specific treatment. Robust solutions are found for bounded classes containing well-defined but not exactly specified input characteristics. Several properties for some special cases of interest are examined, and an example is given to illustrate the usefulness of the results. Finally, the results are applied to a narrowband spatial array system, for which the robust scheme has an interesting and useful characteristic.

#* Robust detection of signals: a large deviations approach
#@ George V. Moustakides
#t 1985
#c IEEE Transactions on Information Theory
#! Robust detection of a signal is considered for the case of independent and identically distributed observations. Following an asymptotic but nonlocal approach, the exponential rates of decrease of the error probabilities are considered as measure of performance. Under this measure a robust detection structure for the symmetric density case is derived. This detection structure is a generalization of an existing result for the local case and is reduced to it when the signal magnitude tends to zero.

It is shown that the family ofq-ary generalized Reed-Solomon codes is identical to the family ofq-ary linear codes generated by matrices of the form[I|A], whereIis the identity matrix, andAis a generalized Cauchy matrix. Using Cauchy matrices, a construction is shown of maximal triangular arrays over GF(q), which are constant along diagonals in a Hankel matrix fashion, and with the property that every square subarray is a nonsingular matrix. By taking rectangular subarrays of the described triangles, it is possible to construct generator matrices[I|A]of maximum distance separable codes, whereAis a Hankel matrix. The parameters of the codes are(n,k,d), for1 leq n leq q+ 1, 1 leq k leq n, andd=n-k+1.

#* Estimating the frequency of a noisy sinusoid by linear regression
#@ Steven A Tretter
#t 1985
#c IEEE Transactions on Information Theory
#! The estimation of the parameters of a sinusoid from observations of signal samples corrupted by additive noise is investigated. At high signal-to-noise ratios the additive noise is viewed as an equivalent phase noise, suggesting frequency and phase estimation by linear regression on the signal phase. The variances of the regression estimates are shown to achieve the Cramer-Rao bounds. A formula for the variance of the regression frequency estimator is derived in terms of the noise power spectrum. A simple formula for the variance with1/f^{2}phase noise is presented.

#! The problem of finding a detector nonlinearity that maximizes the efficacy (or asymptotic processing gain) over a class of suboptimal nonlinearities is considered. It is shown that this efficacy maximization problem is essentially the same as the problem of finding the minimum-mean-square-error approximation to the locally optimal detector nonlinearity. This result is compared with some intuitive ideas about suboptimal detection.

#* FINGER: A Symbolic System for Automatic Generation of Numerical Programs in Finite Element Analysis
#@ Paul S. Wang
#t 1986
#c Journal of Symbolic Computation
#% 507344
#% 508465
#% 509058
#! FINGER is a LISP-based system to derive formulas needed in finite element analysis, and to generate FORTRAN code from these formulas. The generated programs can be used with existing, FORTRAN-based finite element analysis packages. This approach aims to replace tedious hand computations that are time consuming and error prone. The design and implementation of FINGER are presented. Techniques for generating efficient code are discussed. These include automatic intermediate expression labelling, interleaving formula derivation with code generation, exploiting symmetry through generated functions and subroutines. Current capabilities include generation of material matrices, strain-displacement matrices and stiffness matrices. FINGER contains a package, called GENTRAN, that translates symbolic formulas into FORTRAN. GENTRAN can generate functions, subroutines and entire programs. Thus, it is also of interest as a general-purpose FORTRAN code generator, Aside from the finite element application, the techniques developed and employed are useful for automatic code generation in general.

Two results about the Euclidean algorithm (EA) for Gaussian integers are proven in this paper: first, a general kind of division with remainder for Gaussian integers @x, @h is considered: @x = @c@h + @r, where we only require that @c is a Gaussian integer; N(@r), the norm of @r, need not be minimal or smaller than N(@h). This leads to a general version of the (EA), where an arbitrary remainder in this sense may be chosen at every division. We show that for every input the number of divisions is minimal, if a remainder of minimal norm is chosen at every step. We call such a version a minimal remainder-version of (EA). We also show that even the slightest deviation from a minimal remainder-version (in a sense to be defined) can lead to an increase in the number of divisions. Second, we establish a tight upper bound for the number of divisions of (EA) for an input of given size, and, equivalently, we determine the input values u, v with norm of u minimal, such that (EA) requires a given number of divisions. This is analogous to Lame's result for rational integers.

#! Most resolution theorem provers convert a theorem into clause form before attempting to find a proof. The conventional translation of a first-order formula into clause form often obscures the structure of the formula, and may increase the length of the formula by an exponential amount in the worst case. We present a non-standard clause form translation that preserves more of the structure of the formula than the conventional translation. This new translation also avoids the exponential increase in size which may occur with the standard translation. We show how this idea may be combined with the idea of replacing predicates by their definitions before converting to clause form. We give a method of lock resolution which is appropriate for the non-standard clause form translation, and which has yielded a spectacular reduction in search space and time for one example. These techniques should increase the attractiveness of resolution theorem provers for program verification applications, since the theorems that arise in program verification are often simple but tedious for humans to prove.

#* Elementary and Liouvillian Solutions of Linear Differential Equations
#@ J. H. Davenport;M. F. Singer
#t 1986
#c Journal of Symbolic Computation
#! Let L(y) = b be a linear differential equation with coefficients in a differential field k, of characteristic 0, We show that if L(y) = b has a non-zero solution Liouvillian over k, then either L(y) = 0 has a non-zero solution u such that u'/u is algebraic over k, or L(y) = b has a solution in k. If L(y) = b has a non-zero solution elementary over k, then either L(y) = 0 has a non-zero solution algebraic over k, or L(y) = b has a solution in k. This latter fact is a consequence of the fact that if L(y) = b has a solution elementary over k, then it has a solution of the form P(log u"1,..., log u"m), where P is a polynomial with coefficients algebraic over k whose degree is at most equal to the order of L(y), and the u; are algebraic over k. Algorithmic considerations are also discussed.

#! A method is presented for permitting record updates by long-lived transactions without forbidding simultaneous access by other users to records modified. Earlier methods presented separately by Gawlick and Reuter are comparable but concentrate on “hot-spot” situations, where even short transactions cannot lock frequently accessed fields without causing bottlenecks. The Escrow Method offered here is designed to support nonblocking record updates by transactions that are “long lived” and thus require long periods to complete. Recoverability of intermediate results prior to commit thus becomes a design goal, so that updates as of a given time can be guaranteed against memory or media failure while still retaining the prerogative to abort. This guarantee basically completes phase one of a two-phase commit, and several advantages result: (1) As with Gawlick's and Reuter's methods, high-concurrency items in the database will not act as a bottleneck; (2) transaction commit of different updates can be performed asynchronously, allowing natural distributed transactions; indeed, distributed transactions in the presence of delayed messages or occasional line disconnection become feasible in a way that we argue will tie up minimal resources for the purpose intended; and (3) it becomes natural to allow for human interaction in the middle of a transaction without loss of concurrent access or any special difficulty for the application programmer. The Escrow Method, like Gawlick's Fast Path and Reuter's Method, requires the database system to be an “expert” about the type of transactional updates performed, most commonly updates involving incremental changes to aggregate quantities. However, the Escrow Method is extendable to other types of updates.

#! This paper deals with the transaction management aspects of the R* distributed database system. It concentrates primarily on the description of the R* commit protocols, Presumed Abort (PA) and Presumed Commit (PC). PA and PC are extensions of the well-known, two-phase (2P) commit protocol. PA is optimized for read-only transactions and a class of multisite update transactions, and PC is optimized for other classes of multisite update transactions. The optimizations result in reduced intersite message traffic and log writes, and, consequently, a better response time. The paper also discusses R*'s approach toward distributed deadlock detection and resolution.

#* Robust estimation of three-dimensional motion parameters from a sequence of imag
#@ Yoshio Yasumoto;Gerard Medioni
#t 1986
#c IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence
#! In this paper, we look at the issue of accurate estimation of the three-dimensional motion parameters of a rigid body from a sequence of synthetic images, and relate the effect of some parameters to the shape of an error function. We first consider the case where only a small set of corresponding points is identified and suggest that a technique called regularization improves the quality and stability of a solution. We then observe that, if more pairs of corresponding points are available, the error function becomes smooth and the solution stable. Finally, we try to improve the quality of estimation by considering more than two consecutive frames for a moving camera looking at a stationary scene, and summing the error functions obtained for any two consecutive frames. Surprisingly enough, this technique does not improve stability unless we use regularization again.

#* A model-based method for rotation invariant texture classification
#@ Rangasami L. Kashyap;Alireza Khotanzad
#t 1986
#c IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence
#! This paper presents a new model-based approach for texture classification which is rotation invariant, i.e., the recognition accuracy is not affected if the orientation of the test texture is different from the orientation of the training samples. The method uses three statistical features, two of which are obtained from a new parametric model of the image called a ``circular symmetric autoregressive model.'' Two of the proposed features have physical interpretation in terms of the roughness and directionality of the texture. The results of several classification experiments on differently oriented samples of natural textures including both microtextures and macrotextures are presented.

#* A combinatorial approach for classification of patterns with missing information and random orientation
#@ Thomas E. Flick;Lee K. Jones
#t 1986
#c IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence
#! A maximum likelihood approach is developed for a pattern recognition problem where the patterns are described by configurations of simple easily recognized parts called primitives. The approach is capable of dealing with three types of noise: measurement noise in the location and shape of observed primitives, undetected or missing primitives (leakage), and the unexpected appearance of extra primitives (false alarms). The approach is called combinatorial because the likelihood function dictates that observed primitives must be assigned to known primitives in all possible combinations. Due to the complexity of the likelihood function, practical classifiers must be based on likelihood function approximations. Several are proposed, and most of these are simple enough to be used in a gradient search strategy for recognizing distorted patterns with random orientations. Examples are included to show the characteristics of combinatorial classifier performance.

#! Inference of Markov networks from finite sets of sample strings is formulated using dynamic programming. Strings are installed in a network sequentially via optimal string-to-network alignments computed with a dynamic programming matrix, the cost function of which uses relative frequency estimates of transition probabilities to emphasize landmark substrings common to the sample set. Properties of an inferred network are described and the method is illustrated with artificial data and with data representing banded human chromosomes.

#@ Gustavo Belforte;Balisio Bona;Roberto Tempo
#t 1986
#c IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence
#! This paper considers the problem of stopping rules, in the context of sequential Bayesian classification. In particular a new criterion, based on the probability of reversal of the obtained classification, is introduced and compared to more commonly used strategies. The results show good behavior of the proposed technique, with both simulated and real data drawn from biomedical application. In fact it appears that this stopping rule reduces the misallocation error rate with the same mean number of used features, or conversely, with an equal level of misallocation error rate, it reduces the mean number of features necessary to attain it.

Prominence values are used to classify axes as either major or minor, and minor axes are then deleted. An augmented medial axis transform is also defined using an approximate Euclidean distance transform, and medial axis interpolation and linking.

#@ Lawrence O'Gorman;Arthur C. Sanderson
#t 1986
#c IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence
#! In [1], the converging squares algorithm was introduced as a method designed to effectively and efficiently locate peaks in data of two dimensions or higher. In this correspondence, the performance of the algorithm on a signal in noise is examined, and some extensions of the algorithm-beyond peak-picking-are introduced. The minimum-area enclosing square is one extension, which locates an image region in a uniform background, and finds the smallest square which entirely encloses it. The maximum-difference enclosing square is another extension by which a global feature of the image is found which separates it into a foreground square region and background region, based on the maximum statistical difference between the two. Some applications of these extensions are shown, including object location, tracking of a moving object, and adaptive binarization.

#* Three-view stereo analysis
#@ Minoru Ito;Akira Ishii
#t 1986
#c IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence
#! This correspondence describes a new stereo analysis method using three views, in which correspondence is established among three images taken from triangularly configured viewpoints. Each match-point candidate obtained by the initial matching between the first and second images is easily examined independently of the other candidates using the third image. The correspondence determination is simple, fast, and reliable. Additionally, this analysis method allows occlusion to be dealt with explicitly. The effectiveness of the three-view stereo-analysis method is demonstrated by simulation and real object experiments. Ambiguous matches are sufficiently avoided for polyhedra. Position errors are less than 2.5 mm (about 0.4 percent) with camera-object spacing of 630 mm.

#* Consistent operations on a spatial data structure
#@ Andreas Meier;Markus Ilg
#t 1986
#c IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence
#! Geometric objects such as polygons, line segments, and points may have manifold relations among each other, i.e., order, adjacency, connectivity, etc., and may be stored in a database. For the design of the spatial data structure and in order to preserve consistency when manipulating the data, we propose a graph grammar approach. All consistent states are described by a structure graph, and the manipulation rules are given by productions where intersection problems as well as topologic properties have to be solved. By appropriately modeling the behavior of geographic data, consistency is preserved at all times. This eliminates the tedious case of recovering a geographic database after an inconsistency has been detected.

This model allows the system to determine the optimal buffer space to be allocated to a query; it can also be used by the query optimizer to derive efficient execution plans accounting for the available buffer space, and by a query scheduler to prevent thrashing. The hot-set model is compared with the working-set model. A simulation study is presented.

The temporally oriented data model (TODM) presented in this paper is a result of a different approach, namely, it directly operationalizes the pervasive three-dimensional metaphor for time. One of the main results is thus the development of the notion of the data cube: a three-dimensional and inherently temporal data construct where time, objects, and attributes are the primary dimensions of stored data. TODM's cube adds historical depth to the tabular notions of data and provides a framework for storing and retrieving data within their temporal context. The basic operations in the model allow the formation of new cubic views from existing ones, or viewing data as one moves up and down in time within cubes.This paper introduces TODM, a consistent set of temporally oriented data constructs, operations, and constraints, and then presents TOSQL, a corresponding end-user's SQL-like query syntax. The model is a restricted but consistent superset of the relational model, and the query syntax incorporates temporal notions in a manner that likewise avoids penalizing users who are interested solely in the current view of data (rather than in a temporal perspective). The naturalness of the spatial reference to time and the added semantic capacity of TODM come with a price—the definitions of the cubic constructs and basic operations are relatively cumbersome. As rudimentary as it is, TODM nonetheless provides a comprehensive basis for formulating an external data model for a temporally oriented database.

#! A uniform I/O interface allows programs to be written relatively independently of specific I/O services and yet work with a wide variety of the I/O services available in a distributed environment. Ideally, the interface provides this uniform access without excessive complexity in the interface or loss of performance. However, a uniform interface does not arise from careful design of individual system interfaces alone; it requires explicit definition.In this paper, the UIO (uniform I/O) system interface that has been used for the past five years in the V distributed operating system is described, with the focus on the key design issues. This interface provides several extensions beyond the I/O interface of UNIX™, including support for record I/O, locking, atomic transactions, and replication, as well as attributes that indicate whether optional semantics and operations are available. Experience in using and implementing this interface with a variety of different I/O services is described, along with the performance of both local and network I/O. It is concluded that the UIO interface provides a uniform I/O system interface with significant functionality, wide applicability, and no significant performance penalty.

#! A database design methodology is defined for the design of large relational databases. First, the data requirements are conceptualized using an extended entity-relationship model, with the extensions being additional semantics such as ternary relationships, optional relationships, and the generalization abstraction. The extended entity-relationship model is then decomposed according to a set of basic entity-relationship constructs, and these are transformed into candidate relations. A set of basic transformations has been developed for the three types of relations: entity relations, extended entity relations, and relationship relations. Candidate relations are further analyzed and modified to attain the highest degree of normalization desired.The methodology produces database designs that are not only accurate representations of reality, but flexible enough to accommodate future processing requirements. It also reduces the number of data dependencies that must be analyzed, using the extended ER model conceptualization, and maintains data integrity through normalization. This approach can be implemented manually or in a simple software package as long as a "good" solution is acceptable and absolute optimality is not required.

#! Office automation impact has received considerable attention in the literature recently. Unfortunately, that which has appeared is diverse and contradictory. The relevant literature is reviewed, summarized, and placed in a framework containing three positions on office automation impact: optimism, pessimism, and relativism. The basic assumptions and empirical support for each position are noted and analyzed. It is proposed that these positions are based on a number of a priori views which guide the reporting and beliefs about technological impact.

#! In a large integrated database, there often exists an “information hierarchy,” where both raw data and derived data are stored and used together. Therefore, among update transactions, there will often be some that perform only read accesses from a certain (i.e., the “raw” data) portion of the database and write into another (i.e., the “derived” data) portion. A conventional concurrency control algorithm would have treated such transactions as regular update transactions and subjected them to the usual protocols for synchronizing update transactions. In this paper such transactions are examined more closely. The purpose is to devise concurrency control methods that allow the computation of derived information to proceed without interfering with the updating of raw data.The first part of the paper presents a proof method for correctness of concurrency control algorithms in a hierarchically decomposed database. The proof method provides a framework for understanding the intricacies in dealing with hierarchically decomposed databases. The second part of the paper is an application of the proof method to show the correctness of a two-phase-locking- based algorithm, called partitioned two-phase locking, for hierarchically decomposed databases. This algorithm is a natural extension to the Version Pool method proposed previously in the literature.

#! The design and correctness of a communication facility for a distributed computer system are reported on. The facility provides support for fault-tolerant process groups in the form of a family of reliable multicast protocols that can be used in both local- and wide-area networks. These protocols attain high levels of concurrency, while respecting application-specific delivery ordering constraints, and have varying cost and performance that depend on the degree of ordering desired. In particular, a protocol that enforces causal delivery orderings is introduced and shown to be a valuable alternative to conventional asynchronous communication protocols. The facility also ensures that the processes belonging to a fault-tolerant process group will observe consistent orderings of events affecting the group as a whole, including process failures, recoveries, migration, and dynamic changes to group properties like member rankings. A review of several uses for the protocols in the ISIS system, which supports fault-tolerant resilient objects and bulletin boards, illustrates the significant simplification of higher level algorithms made possible by our approach.

#! A topologically complete set operations algorithm for planar polyhedral Z-manifold objects is described; that is, under the assumption that all numerical tests required can be correctly evaluated, the algorithm is capable of solving all “special cases."The central component of the algorithm is a module here called the vertex neighborhood classifier. By virtue of the classifier, the various special cases can be reduced into a collection of classification problems involving a pair of coincident vertices. The classifier works by means of decision rules that guarantee the topological consistency and regularity of the resulting polyhedron. If the result is not a 2-manifold, a relaxed polyhedron will be produced.

#! Reaching agreement is a primitive of distributed computing. Whereas this poses no problem in an ideal, failure-free environment, it imposes certain constraints on the capabilities of an actual system: A system is viable only if it permits the existence of consensus protocols tolerant to some number of failures. Fischer et al. have shown that in a completely asynchronous model, even one failure cannot be tolerated. In this paper their work is extended: Several critical system parameters, including various synchrony conditions, are identified and how varying these affects the number of faults that can be tolerated is examined. The proofs expose general heuristic principles that explain why consensus is possible in certain models but not possible in others.

#! The problem of scheduling a set of n jobs on m identical machines so as to minimize the makespan time is perhaps the most well-studied problem in the theory of approximation algorithms for NP-hard optimization problems. In this paper the strongest possible type of result for this problem, a polynomial approximation scheme, is presented. More precisely, for each &egr;, an algorithm that runs in time O((n/&egr;)1/&egr;2) and has relative error at most &egr; is given. In addition, more practical algorithms for &egr; = 1/5 + 2-k and &egr; = 1/6 + 2-k, which have running times O(n(k + log n)) and O(n(km4 + log n)) are presented. The techniques of analysis used in proving these results are extremely simple, especially in comparison with the baroque weighting techniques used previously.The scheme is based on a new approach to constructing approximation algorithms, which is called dual approximation algorithms, where the aim is to find superoptimal, but infeasible, solutions, and the performance is measured by the degree of infeasibility allowed. This notion should find wide applicability in its own right and should be considered for any optimization problem where traditional approximation algorithms have been particularly elusive.

#! Today's concomitant needs for higher computing power and reliability has increased the relevance of multiple-processor fault-tolerant systems. Multiple functional units improve the raw performance (throughput, response time, etc.) of the system, and, as units fail, the system may continue to function albeit with degraded performance. Such systems and other fault-tolerant systems are not adequately characterized by separate performance and reliability measures. A composite measure for the performance and reliability of a fault-tolerant system observed over a finite mission time is analyzed. A Markov chain model is used for system state-space representation, and transient analysis is performed to obtain closed-form solutions for the density and moments of the composite measure. Only failures that cannot be repaired until the end of the mission are modeled. The time spent in a specific system configuration is assumed to be large enough to permit the use of a hierarchical model and static measures to quantify the performance of the system in individual configurations. For a multiple-processor system, where performance measures are usually associated with and aggregated over many jobs, this is tantamount to assuming that the time to process a job is much smaller than the time between failures. An extension of the results to general acyclic Markov chain models is included.

#! A series of three laboratory experiments were conducted to assess the influence of graphical and color-enhanced information presentation modes on decision quality, decision making time, use of information, and user perceptions. The experimental design allowed for the unconfounded study of line graphs and color using a variety of information presentation designs for the same decision making task. Based on the findings of these studies, propositions about the impact of graphics and color on individual decision makers are presented. The influence of presentation mode on human performance and the perceived value of information is related to how well it supports the solution approach to a particular task. The benefits of graphics are limited to reducing decision making time but only when the graphical report has been designed to directly assist in solving the task. Multicolor reports aid in decision making, but only in specific circumstances, that is, their benefits are not pervasive. It appears that color is more advantageous when associated with graphical reports, for certain decision maker types, during learning periods, and in time constrained environments.

#! Pattern matching is a common and fundamental operation of many applications, such as expert systems (ES). With continued growth the knowledge bases of such systems will need database management systems (DBMS) support. Providing this support will require extending DBMS to meet the needs of these systems. We have developed an operator that extends the relational data model to do pattern matching with very complex stored patterns.

#! Parallel computers with tens of thousands of processors are typically programmed in a data parallel style, as opposed to the control parallel style used in multiprocessing. The success of data parallel algorithms—even on problems that at first glance seem inherently serial—suggests that this style of programming has much wider applicability than was previously thought.

#! A simple extension of the relational model is introduced to study the effects of dynamic constraints on database evolution. Both static and dynamic constraints are used in conjunction with the model. The static constraints considered here are functional dependencies (FDs). The dynamic constraints involve global updates and are restricted to certain analogs of FDs, called “dynamic” FDs. The results concern the effect of the dynamic constraints on the static constraints satisfied by the database in the course of time. The effect of the past history of the database on the static constraints is investigated using the notions of age and age closure. The connection between the static constraints and the potential future evolution of the database is briefly discussed using the notions of survivability and survivability closure.

#! The problem of electing a leader in a synchronous ring of n processors is considered. Both positive and negative results are obtained. On the one hand, if processor IDS are chosen from some countable set, then there is an algorithm that uses only O(n) messages in the worst case. On the other hand, any algorithm that is restricted to use only comparisons of IDs requires &OHgr;(n log n) messages in the worst case. Alternatively, if the number of rounds is required to be bounded by some t in the worst case, and IDs are chosen from any set having at least ƒ(n, t) elements, for a certain very fast-growing function ƒ, then any algorithm requires &OHgr;(n log n) messages in the worst case.

#! Accurate simulation of light propagation within an environment and perceptually based imaging techniques are necessary for the creation of realistic images. A physical experiment that verifies the simulation of reflected light intensities for diffuse environments was conducted. Measurements of radiant energy flux densities are compared with predictions using the radiosity method for those physical environments. By using color science procedures the results of the light model simulation are then transformed to produce a color television image. The final image compares favorably with the original physical model. The experiment indicates that, when the physical model and the simulation were viewed through a view camera, subjects could not distinguish between them. The results and comparison of both test procedures are presented within this paper.

#! A theory is given that accounts for the observed behavior of Runge-Kutta codes when the stepsize is restricted by stability. The theory deals with the general case when the dominant eigenvalues of the Jacobian may be a complex conjugate pair. This extends and generalizes the results of Part I of this paper, which deal with the real case. Familiarity with Part I is assumed, but not essential.

#! A general procedure for the construction of interpolants for Runge-Kutta (RK) formulas is presented. As illustrations, this approach is used to develop interpolants for three explicit RK formulas, including those employed in the well-known subroutines RKF45 and DVERK. A typical result is that no extra function evaluations are required to obtain an interpolant with O(h5) local truncation error for the fifth-order RK formula used in RKF45; two extra function evaluations per step are required to obtain an interpolant with O(h6) local truncation error for this RK formula.

#! The power of shared-memory in models of parallel computation is studied, and a novel distributed data structure that eliminates the need for shared memory without significantly increasing the run time of the parallel computation is described. More specifically, it is shown how a complete network of processors can deterministically simulate one PRAM step in O(log n/(log log n)2) time when both models use n processors and the size of the PRAM's shared memory is polynomial in n. (The best previously known upper bound was the trivial O(n)). It is established that this upper bound is nearly optimal, and it is proved that an on-line simulation of T PRAM steps by a complete network of processors requires &OHgr;(T(log n/ log log n)) time.A simple consequence of the upper bound is that an Ultracomputer (the currently feasible general-purpose parallel machine) can simulate one step of a PRAM (the most convenient parallel model to program) in O((log n)2log log n) steps.

#! It is reasonable to expect parallel machines to be faster than sequential ones. But exactly how much faster do we expect them to be? Various authors have observed that an exponential speedup is possible if sufficiently many processors are available. One such author has claimed (erroneously) that this is a counterexample to the parallel computation thesis. We show that even more startling speedups are possible. In fact, if enough processors are used, any recursive function can be computed in constant time. Although such machines clearly do not obey the parallel computation thesis, we argue that they still provide evidence in favour of it. In contrast, we show that an arbitrary polynomial speedup of sequential machines is possible on a model which satisfies the parallel computation thesis. If, as widely conjectured, P⊈POLYLOGSPACE, then there can be no exponential speedup on such a model.

#! Ray tracing, ray casting, and other forms of point sampling are important techniques in computer graphics, but their usefulness has been undermined by aliasing artifacts. In this paper it is shown that these artifacts are not an inherent part of point sampling, but a consequence of using regularly spaced samples. If the samples occur at appropriate nonuniformly spaced locations, frequencies above the Nyquist limit do not alias, but instead appear as noise of the correct average intensity. This noise is much less objectionable to our visual system than aliasing. In ray tracing, the rays can be stochastically distributed to perform a Monte Carlo evaluation of integrals in the rendering equation. This is called distributed ray tracing and can be used to simulate motion blur, depth of field, penumbrae, gloss, and translucency.

#! Exponential lower bounds are proved for the length-of-resolution refutations of sets of disjunctions constructed from expander graphs, using the method of Tseitin. Since these sets of clauses encode biconditionals, they have short (polynomial-length) refutations in a standard axiomatic formulation of propositional calculus.

#! A continuum of disk scheduling algorithms, V(R), having endpoints V(0) = SSTF and V(1) = SCAN, is defined. V(R) maintains a current SCAN direction (in or out) and services next the request with the smallest effective distance. The effective distance of a request that lies in the current direction is its physical distance (in cylinders) from the read/write head. The effective distance of a request in the opposite direction is its physical distance plus R x (total number of cylinders on the disk). By use of simulation methods, it is shown that this definitional continuum also provides a continuum in performance, both with respect to the mean and with respect to the standard deviation of request waiting time. For objective functions that are linear combinations of the two measures, &mgr;w + kow, intermediate points of the continuum are seen to provide performance uniformly superior to both SSTF and SCAN. A method of implementing V(R) and the results of its experimental use in a real system are presented.

#! A measure of efficiency of simultaneous methods for determination of polynomial zeros, defined by the coefficient of efficiency, is considered. This coefficient takes into consideration (1) the R-order of convergence in the sense of the definition introduced by Ortega and Rheinboldt (Iterative Solution of Nonlinear Equations in Several Variables. Academic Press, New York, 1970) and (2) the number of basic arithmetic operations per iteration, taken with certain weights depending on a processor time. The introduced definition of computational efficiency was used for comparison of the simultaneous methods with various structures.

These sequences for various F (multiplicative group, reduced elliptic curves and Abelian varieties) provide a variety of new primality tests like Lucas' test for Mersenne primes. Implementations and relations with factorization algorithms are presented.

#* Rapid dynamic programming algorithms for RNA secondary structure
#@ 
#t 1986
#c Advances in Applied Mathematics
#! Prediction of RNA secondary structure from the linear RNA sequence is an important mathematical problem in molecular biology. Dynamic programming methods are currently the most useful computer technique but are frequently very expensive in running time. In this paper new dynamic programming algorithms are presented which reduce the required computation. The first polynomial time algorithm is given for predicting general secondary structure.

#* Regularity for a singular conservation law
#@ 
#t 1986
#c Advances in Applied Mathematics
#! The main structure underlying the nonlinearity of conservation laws of gasdynamical type in two independent variables will be discussed at the hand of a canonical example describing also properties of water waves near shore. The ultimately singular nature of such laws is here the central issue and calls for an unusual formulation (Sect. 2). Attention is directed to the globally strong solutions, and an unusual regularization (Sect. 2) is employed to make them accessible, after illposedness is overcome (Sect. 3). The usual regularity theory is not normally sufficient for singular partial differential equations, and the necessary additional chapter on extensions to the singular locus is developed (Sect. 4) in detail for the canonical example. Criteria for the relation between regularized and strong solutions are discussed in Section 5 and used in Section 6 to characterize the class of solutions that are globally strong in the strictest sense.

#* Drawing Ada structure charts
#@ B Burkhard;M Lee
#t 1986
#c ACM SIGAda Ada Letters
#! This paper describes a method for drawing Ada structure charts and "with"ing trees. This method was used at GTE in developing the Ada version of a project management tool, TRACKER, for NOSC. The paper defines a set of symbols for various Ada entities. It further describes how these symbols can be combined to show nesting, packaging, "with"ing, generic instantiation, exported procedures and data, or any combination thereof. It also shows how visibility can be easily traced from the structure chart. Several examples are shown, including portions of the actual chart for Tracker. The paper concludes with a brief discussion of the benefits and limitations of this method, and compares it to those of Booch and Buhr.

#* A complete notation for Ada charts
#@ J M Bishop
#t 1986
#c ACM SIGAda Ada Letters
#! Several attempts have been made to define notations for diagrams that can represent the structure of an Ada program in terms of the interaction between its packages and tasks1, 2, 3. While handling the issue of visibility fairly well, none of these gives any guidance for the more difficult areas of Ada, such as generics, task creation and exceptions. The notation described here is complete. It employs a few carefully chosen features in a consistent way to construct an easily understandable chart of an Ada system. The notation is adaptable for use by hand or by computers with graphic capabilities.

#! Synchronization errors in concurrent programs are notoriously difficult to find and correct. Deadlock, partial deadlock, and unsafeness are conditions that constitute such errors.A model of concurrent semaphore programs based on multidimensional, solid geometry is presented. While previously reported geometric models are restricted to two-process mutual exclusion problems, the model described here applies to a broader class of synchronization problems. The model is shown to be exact for systems composed of an arbitrary, yet fixed number of concurrent processes, each consisting of a straight line sequence of arbitrarily ordered semaphore operations.

#! Naming and addressing are areas in which there is still a need for clarification. Many definitions for names, addresses, and routes have been proposed, but the exact relations among these concepts are obscure. A taxonomy of names, addresses, and routes is presented. First, we identify names and routes as the essential concepts of communication. Then, addresses are introduced as an intermediate form that eases the process of mapping between names and routes; an original definition of an address is thus proposed. Relations among names, addresses, and routes are explained with the concept of mapping. On this basis, a general model relating names, addresses, and routes is built and then applied recursively throughout a layered architecture, leading to a layered naming and addressing model which may play the same role for naming and addressing features that the OS1 reference model plays for the definition of services and protocols. Finally, the model is particularized to a typical network architecture. The model may also be applied to non-OSI layered systems; naming, addressing, and routing issues in any network architecture could be a particular instance of this layered model.

#! Every information system incorporates a database component, and a frequent activity of users of information systems is to present it with queries. These queries reflect the presuppositions of their authors about the system and the information it contains. With most query processors, queries that are based on erroneous presuppositions often result in null answers. These fake nulls are misleading, since they do not point out the user's erroneous presuppositions (and can even be interpreted as their affirmation). This article describes the SEAVE mechanism for extracting presuppositions from queries and verifying their correctness. The verification is done against three repositories of information: the actual data, their integrity constraints, and their completeness assertions. Consequently, queries that reflect erroneous presuppositions are answered with informative messages instead of null answers, and user-system communication is thus improved (an aspect that is particularly important in systems that often are accessed by naive users). First, the principles of SEAVE are described abstractly. Then, specific algorithms for implementing it with relational databases are presented, including a new method for storing knowledge and an efficient algorithm for processing queries against the knowledge.

Most descriptive studies of the office have placed great emphasis on manifest office actions, suggesting that offices are the embodiment of these actions. The meanings of these actions or tasks, however, have been given scant attention. There exist a number of office activity or task taxonomies, but they do little more than provide a simple and limited structure through which to conceive of an office. From a social-analytic perspective this appears to be overly simplistic and misses the richness of social action in an office. Focusing on the overt and manifest aspects of the office may very well lead to its misrepresentation. This paper takes a critical look at the way offices are conceived in the office automation literature and suggests alternatives that may provide a better understanding of the real functions of an office.

#! MINOS is an object-oriented multimedia information system that provides integrated facilities for creating and managing complex multimedia objects. In this paper the model for multimedia documents supported by MINOS and its implementation is described. Described in particular are functions provided in MINOS that exploit the capabilities of a modern workstation equipped with image and voice input-output devices to accomplish an active multimedia document presentation and browsing within documents. These functions are powerful enough to support a variety of office applications. Also described are functions provided for the extraction of information from multimedia documents that exist in a large repository of information (multimedia document archiver) and functions that select and transform this information. Facilities for information sharing among objects of the archiver are described; an interactive multimedia editor that is used for the extraction and interactive creation of new information is outlined; finally, a multimedia document formatter that is used to synthesize a new multimedia document from extracted and interactively generated information is presented.This prototype system runs on a SUN-3 workstation running UNIX'". An Instavox, directly addressable, analog device is used to store voice segments.
